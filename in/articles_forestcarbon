Using previously published data, this research sought to assess the change in carbon pools caused by humans in the Lower Fraser Basin (LFB) in British Columbia, Canada, since 1827 and define the long-term, regional contribution of carbon to the atmosphere. The results indicate that. there has been a transfer of 270 Mt of carbon from biomass pools in the LFB to other pools, primarily the atmosphere. The major losses of biomass carbon have been from logged forests (42\%), wetlands (14\%), and soils (43\%). Approximately 48\% of the forest biomass, almost 20\% of the carbon of the LFB, lies within old-growth forest, which covers only 19\% of the study area. landfills are now becoming a major sink of carbon, containing 5\% of the biomass carbon in the LFB, while biomass carbon in buildings, urban vegetation, mammals, and agriculture is negligible. Approximately 26\% of logged forest biomass would still be in a terrestrial biomass pool, leaving 238 Mt of carbon that has been released to the atmosphere. On an area basis, this is 29 times the average global emissions of carbon, providing an indication of the past contributions of developed countries such as Canada to global warming and possible contributions from further clearing of rainforest in both tropical and temperate regions.","USER-NOTES: {""shannon.clarke""=>[""mentions carbon in urban vegetation""]} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included"", ""ericapadvaiskas""=>""Included"", ""Emily""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Emily""=>[""This paper investigates changes in the carbon pool in the Lower Fraser Basin, but mostly ignores the urban forest in its research.

We carried out an ecosystem services (ES) assessment at the Rizoelia National Forest Park, a biodiversity hotspot in Cyprus. For ES assessment we used TESSA v.1.1 and an ES matrix-approach to map the capacity of habitat types in the area. According to TESSA the most important ES provided by the study area are aesthetic benefits, recreation/tourism, biodiversity, global climate regulation, and environmental education. Total Carbon stock was estimated to 14247.327 tonnes and the total number of annual visits was 14471. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of visits among visitation periods but there were statistically significant differences among National Holidays, Weekends and Weekdays. We identified that plantations had the highest capacity for most groups of services particularly where their understory comprises semi-natural habitat types rich in biodiversity. This is the first study in Cyprus which provides a preliminary quantification of ES in a protected area context using widely employed tools.

Identifying and improving existing ecological security patterns are of great significance for maintaining the sustainable development of cities. In this study, Jinan, the capital of China's Shandong Province, was used as a case study area. Based on three ecosystem services, namely, soil conservation, water conservation and carbon fixation, ecological sources were determined. Furthermore, a resistance surface was constructed based on biodiversity. On these bases, the circuit theory concept of random walks was applied to simulate ecosystem processes in a heterogeneous landscape and identify ecological corridors, pinch points and barriers. A total of 25 ecological sources, 48 ecological corridors and 19 pinch points were identified, and restoration areas were delimited to three levels. These elements together constituted the ecological security patterns. Specifically, the ecological sources were mainly distributed in southern Jinan and were covered mostly with forest land. The ecological corridors were located mainly in the eastern and southwestern plains below the southern mountainous areas and were covered mostly with cropland. Furthermore, the eastern corridors were much longer than the southwestern corridors. Pinch points were distributed mostly along rivers or around large-scale construction land. Barriers were distributed mainly in Zhangqiu District and northern Licheng District. Based on these findings, hierarchical restoration areas were delimited. Differentiated development contradictions in restoration areas were discussed, and corresponding ecological protection measures were proposed. An ecological security optimization pattern of ``one center, two wings, and two belts{''} was finally proposed to provide planning strategies for decision-makers.","USER-NOTES: {""shannon.clarke""=>[""talk about carbon fixation, forest lands, and seems like it could be urban""]} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included"", ""ericapadvaiskas""=>""Included"", ""Emily""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Emily""=>[""Carbon fixation in different land use types (including woodland) was measured.

A case study examining a bio-infiltration rain garden at the Villanova University Campus is offered to demonstrate this methodology. The scope of this analysis is cradle to grave benefits and impacts of green infrastructure. Metrics used in this case study to evaluate benefits and impacts include carbon footprint (global warming potential), acidification potential, human health cancer impact, human health non-cancer impact, respiratory effects, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential, eco-toxicity, smog formation potential, labor impacts, and life cycle economic costs. Results of this bio-infiltration rain garden case study show that the construction phase is the main contributing life cycle phase for all adverse environmental impacts, as well as total life cycle cost and labor impacts. The majority of these construction phase environmental impacts are attributed to the use of silica sand as a soil amendment for the rain garden media and the use of bark mulch to provide ground cover, repress invasive vegetation, and establish target vegetation. The bio-infiltration rain garden operation phase was found to provide significant avoided environmental impacts relative to the construction phase impacts. These avoided impacts are attributed to urban forest benefits from rain garden vegetation, benefits due to stormwater runoff pollutant treatment by the practice, and benefits to combined sewer systems due to reduced stormwater volume through infiltration and evapo-transpiration. Consideration of multiple rain garden decommissioning phase scenarios makes a case to support the onsite reuse on rain garden media at the end of the practice life. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although previous studies have proposed that the impact of the changes in the environmental conditions of vegetation carbon uptake by urban expansion are generally indirect, the processes of this impact are still unclear. In this study, we quantified the indirect effects of urbanization on urban vegetation carbon uptake for unchanged vegetation areas. We extracted unchanged vegetation areas based on multisource remote sensing data from the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The influence of urbanization on vegetation carbon uptake and urban environmental factors in 2004, 2010, and 2016 along with the urban-rural gradient was calculated. In addition, we investigated the relative contribution of urban environmental factors to vegetation carbon uptake to study the relationship between them using a boosted regression tree method. The results showed that urbanization promoted vegetation carbon uptake, which varied with different years in Shanghai. Besides, the promoting effect of urbanization on the carbon uptake of vegetation was mainly due to the increase in temperature and the fragmentation of vegetation landscape patterns in Shanghai. The changes of soil moisture and radiation had little effect on the vegetation carbon uptake. Among the influencing factors, the relative contribution of the vegetation landscape pattern to vegetation carbon uptake was about 85\%. Considering the crucial role of landscape patterns in the carbon uptake of vegetation, urban managers should consider reducing the negative influence of urbanization on vegetation through landscape design, which will further promote the sustainable development of urban ecology.","USER-NOTES: {""shannon.clarke""=>[""looks good, only question is whether the \""vegetation\"" is woody/trees""]} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included"", ""ericapadvaiskas""=>""Included"", ""Emily""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Emily""=>[""Unclear whether/how much the \""vegetation\"" the study was done on included tree species.

Although ES map quality has received some recent attention in the literature, little is known about the accuracy of these maps in urban contexts or about the factors that influence this accuracy. To address this issue, we quantitatively compared and validated ES maps in a heterogeneous urban landscape to generate insight into ES map accuracy in these environments. Using aboveground biomass carbon storage as an example, we examined how input data resolution and assessment method affect the accuracy of urban ES maps. Two mapping methods were employed: (1) maps based on ecosystem components involved in carbon storage (trees and lawns) and (2) maps based on land-cover proxies and data at coarse and fine spatial resolutions. We compared carbon storage predicted by these methods to that estimated by using field-collected data to examine the accuracy of predictions and spatial variation therein. Different methods and data produced similar study area-wide estimates; however, the spatial distribution of estimates varied among methods. Estimates using ecosystem components agreed with the actual observations better than the proxy-based estimates, although map accuracy was improved by using higher resolution land-cover data. Thus, when study area-wide estimates suffice for decision making, proxy-based methods and coarse-resolution data should provide adequate assessments. Detailed ecosystem structure and composition data are needed when fine-resolution, spatially-explicit estimates are required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included"", ""Emily""=>""Included"", ""Danielle""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Emily""=>[""This is a comparison of the accuracy of different models of carbon storage.

Therefore, we predicted the impacts of different development models on future carbon storage in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region by analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution patterns and driving factors of carbon storage from 1990 to 2015. Taking the YRD urban agglomeration as a case study, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs and future land use simulation models were used to simulate and predict carbon storage in 2050 under four development scenarios based on the patterns in 2015. The results showed that the YRD urban agglomeration experienced carbon storage losses of 1210.54 Tg during 1990-2015, which were driven by socioeconomic factors rather than natural causes. The region is expected to continue experiencing losses of 783, 638, 697, and 621 Tg from 2015 to 2050 under the baseline, slow, fast, and harmonious development scenarios, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach This paper tested three remote sensing methods to determine land use and land cover (LULC), namely, unsupervised classification, supervised classification and supervised classification incorporating delineated wetlands. Using confusion matrices, this paper tested remote sensing approaches to ground-truthed data, the paper obtained via field-based vegetation surveys across a subset of U-M landholdings. Findings In natural areas, supervised classification incorporating delineated wetlands was the most accurate and efficient approach. In urban settings, maps incorporating institutional knowledge and campus tree surveys better estimated LULC. Using LULC and literature-based carbon data, this paper estimated that U-M lands store 1.37-3.68 million metric tons of carbon and sequester 45,000-86,000 Mt CO(2)e/yr, valued at \$2.2m-\$4.3m annually (\$50/metric ton, social cost of carbon).

The assessment of the impact of urbanization on ESs is critical for sustainable urban planning and land policy in China. In this study, we used the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model to assess the changes in ESs based on land use patterns in Beijing from 1984 to 2015. A new comprehensive ecosystem service (CES) index was developed to spatially reflect the total supply of multiple ESs and provide references for policy makers. We further analyzed the trade-offs among various ESs through correlation analysis and designed five alternative scenarios to explore effective strategies which can improve the CES while simultaneously reducing trade-offs among different ESs in Beijing. The results showed that the average CES of Beijing decreased over the past 30 years. The ecological conservation region, which is located to the north and west of Beijing, had the best CES performance. Among the various ESs, services for water purification, soil erosion control, vegetable provision, and fruit provision increased, whereas services for carbon storage, water provision, habitat provision, and grain provision decreased from 1984 to 2015. It's worth noting that sediment export in Beijing showed no significant relationships with regulating and supporting services, which include carbon storage, water purification and habitat provision. To control soil erosion effectively, we should not only increase the area of afforestation but also plant trees on the steeper slopes. In addition, there is a major trade-off between food provision and regulating and supporting services. Vegetation restoration in both riparian zones and previously steep croplands can improve CES at the expense of reducing food provision. Moreover, forestry restoration is proved to be more effective than grass-based restoration. To reduce the trade-offs between food provision and regulating and supporting services and concurrently improve the CES, it is essential to increase the efficiency of food provision per unit area and develop urban vertical agriculture in Beijing.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,Land use change;Ecosystem services;Scenario;Trade-offs;China,,

The GHG emissions produced by the study cases were estimated using the RoadCO(2) estimation tool. Results showed that the total emissions (in kg CO(2)e/m(2)/y) range from 76 for the secondary road case to 1100 for the primary road cases.

The contribution of the remaining categories of the construction phase fluctuates within a certain case and among the considered cases. The equipment used in the construction phase for the three cases contributed 15-70\% of the total phase emissions, while the remaining emissions were due to construction materials. In the operation phase, emissions were mainly generated by vehicle movement. Street lighting also contributed to emissions during the operation phase. On the other hand, the irrigation of planted trees along the road had a very low impact on GHG emissions, and carbon sequestration by these trees had a negligible effect in terms of acting as a carbon sink.

European forests are expanding and becoming denser following the widespread abandonment of farmland and rural areas. Spontaneous forest regrowth provides a cost-effective opportunity to restore ecosystems, enhance multifunctionality and sustainability and mitigate climate change. Yet, little is known about the goods and services that such forests provide to people. We assessed the changes in nature's contributions to people (NCP) from spontaneous forest regrowth, i.e. forest expansion and densification, in South-West Europe. 2. We investigated 65 forest plots in four different landscapes with contrasting ecological and societal contexts. Two landscapes are located in rural areas undergoing human exodus and forest expansion and densification; the other two, in peri-urban areas with intense land use and forest densification but negligible expansion. For each forest plot, we estimated variables related to ten out of the 18 main NCP defined by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Regulating and material NCP were addressed using variables measured in the field as proxies. Non-material NCP were studied through stakeholder interviews. 3. Our results show across the cases that forest expansion and densification are generally associated with greater climate regulation and energy provision. Changes in other NCP, especially in non-material ones, were strongly context-dependent. The social perception of spontaneous forest regrowth was primarily negative in rural areas and more positive in peri-urban landscapes. 4. Passive restoration through spontaneous forest expansion and densification can enhance regulating and material NCP, especially when adaptive management is applied. To optimise NCP and to increase the societal awareness of and interest in spontaneous forest regrowth, the effects of this process should be analysed in close coordination with local stakeholders to unveil and quantify the many and complex trade-offs involved in rural or peri-urban social perceptions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,forest densification;forest expansion;passive restoration;rural abandonment;social perception;spontaneous forest regrowth;stakeholder;Europe,,

The process of urbanization changes terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes, which, in turn, impact ecosystem functions and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Using the Seattle, WA, region as a case study, this paper explores the relationships between aboveground carbon stocks and land cover within an urbanizing area. The major objectives were to estimate aboveground live and dead terrestrial carbon stocks across multiple land cover classes and quantify the relationships between urban cover and vegetation across a gradient of urbanization. We established 154 sample plots in the Seattle region to assess carbon stocks as a function of distance from the urban core and land cover {[}urban (heavy, medium, and low), mixed forest, and conifer forest land covers]. The mean (and 95\% CI) aboveground live biomass for the region was 89 +/- 22 Mg C ha-1 with an additional 11.8 +/- 4 Mg C ha-1 of coarse woody debris biomass. The average live biomass stored within forested and urban land covers was 140 +/- 40 and 18 +/- 14 Mg C ha-1, respectively, with a 57\% mean vegetated canopy cover regionally. Both the total carbon stocks and mean vegetated canopy cover were surprisingly high, even within the heavily urbanized areas, well exceeding observations within other urbanizing areas and the average US forested carbon stocks. As urban land covers and populations continue to rapidly increase across the globe, these results highlight the importance of considering vegetation in urbanizing areas within the terrestrial carbon cycle.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,carbon cycle;climate change;development;mitigation;Pacific Northwest;urban,,

Graziers had carried out extensive clearing of the original trees since the 1820s leaving only scattered remnants and some plantings near homesteads. With the selection of Canberra as the site for the new capital of Australia, extensive tree plantings began in 1911. These trees have delivered a number of benefits, including aesthetic values and the amelioration of climatic extremes. Recently, however, it was considered that the benefits might extend to pollution mitigation and the sequestration of carbon. This paper outlines a case study of the value of the Canberra urban forest with particular reference to pollution mitigation. This study uses a tree inventory, modelling and decision support system developed to collect and use data about trees for tree asset management. The decision support system (DISMUT) was developed to assist in the management of about 400,000 trees planted in Canberra. The size of trees during the 5-year Kyoto Commitment Period was estimated using DISMUT and multiplied by estimates of value per square meter of canopy derived from available literature.

This is particularly important given climate change and environmental deterioration as a result of rapid urbanization. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of urban sprawl on dynamics of forest carbon stock and density in Xiamen, a typical city experiencing rapid urbanization in China. Forest resource inventory data collected from 32,898 patches in 4 years (1972, 1988, 1996 and 2006), together with remotely sensed data (from 1988, 1996 and 2006), were used to investigate vegetation carbon densities and stocks in Xiamen, China. We classified the forests into four groups: (1) forest patches connected to construction land; (2) forest patches connected to farmland; (3) forest patches connected to both construction land and farmland and (4) close forest patches. Carbon stocks and densities of four different types of forest patches during different urbanization periods in three zones (urban core, suburb and exurb) were compared to assess the impact of human disturbance on forest carbon. In the urban core, the carbon stock and carbon density in all four forest patch types declined over the study period. In the suburbs, different urbanization processes influenced forest carbon density and carbon stock in all four forest patch types. Urban sprawl negatively affected the surrounding forests. In the exurbs, the carbon stock and carbon density in all four forest patch types tended to increase over the study period. The results revealed that human disturbance played the dominant role in influencing the carbon stock and density of forest patches close to the locations of human activities. In forest patches far away from the locations of human activities, natural forest regrowth was the dominant factor affecting carbon stock and density. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study estimates the amount of BVOCs carbon emitted in relation to carbon fixation for the built-up areas and rural forests in a subtropical urban-rural complex. Urban greenspace was subdivided into block greenspace and linear greenspace, while rural areas were characterized by four forest types. A field survey was conducted to assess the vegetation composition, biomass and foliar mass for each tree species. Results showed (1) the emissions intensity of BVOC in the greater Ningbo area is 4.48 x 10(6) g C km(-2) yr(-1), the average emission intensity of the greenspace in the built-up areas (2.86 x 10(6) g C km(-2) yr(-1)) is higher than rural forests excluding bamboo forest (2.66 x 10(6) g C km(-2) yr(-1)); (2) the contribution of carbon emitted as BVOCs to net primary production (NPP) (BVOCs/NPP ratio) is about 4.3\%, with 1.8\% for the built-up areas which is lower than that for rural forests including bamboo forest (4.4\%), but higher than rural forests excluding bamboo forest (0.96\%); (3) the BVOCs/NPP ratio between native and exotic tree species exhibits no significant difference. The results suggest that BVOC emissions can be reduced while carbon sequestration can be increased by planting trees with low-emitting but high carbon fixation capacity in built-up areas, and by reducing bamboo forest while restoring broad-leaved forest in rural forests.

In this paper, we demonstrated the opportunistic use of existing leaf-off lidar to map forest structure and associated uncertainties in Madison, Wisconsin and neighboring municipalities. Using empirical models, we were able to map five structural variables and aboveground biomass with accuracies comparable to or better than other studies using comparable data and with errors generally < 20 \% of the data range. Highest uncertainties in our forest structure maps occurred in residential neighborhoods and along forest edges. From the results, we present maps of forest structure and, to our knowledge, first of a kind pixel-wise uncertainty maps for an urban area. These maps provide the basis for a spatially comprehensive assessment of forest resources and are effective for urban inventory and change assessment.

However, tree species used in urban forestry are usually different from the ones used in commercial forestry. As a consequence, available data on growth and yield under alternative management scenarios are usually scarce. As forest models can be used to explore potential forest futures, they are of special interest as decision-support tools in urban forestry. In this research, we used the FORECAST ecosystem-level forest model to define the management prescriptions for Metasequoia glyptostroboides plantations in Shanghai that reach the highest net primary productivity (NPP). In a first step, a battery of different stand densities (from 500 to 4000 stems ha(-1)) was used to identify those with the highest NPP at stand level. Then, different thinning regimes (with intensities ranging from 15\% to 40\% of trees removed and applied at stand age 5 to 20 years) were simulated on those initial densities with the highest NPP (3000 and 4000 stems ha(-1)). Planting 4000 stems ha(-1) and not applying thinning achieved the highest annual NPP (14.39 +/- 3.92 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) during the first rotation, but it was not significantly different from the NPP achieved with the same initial density but thinning 40\% of trees at year 10. NPP was estimated to decrease with consecutive rotations, and for the second rotation thinning was needed to significantly increase NPP (10.11 +/- 2.59 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with 4000 stems ha(-1) and 25\% thinning at year 10) above non-thinning management. For the third rotation, the highest NPP was reached with initial density 3000 stems ha(-1) and 25\% thinning at year 10. Nitrogen flows were also estimated to decrease with consecutive rotations. These results indicate the potential of managing M. glyptostroboides urban plantations to reach their maximum productivity potential, but also that additional actions would be needed to ensure adequate nutrient levels over consecutive rotations. For a species such as M. glyptostroboides, which was discovered for science less than 70 years ago and for which no plantations over 50 years exist, the ecosystem-level FORECAST model has been shown as a suitable tool to support management decision when growth and yield data are not available.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,urban forest;FORECAST model;tree densities;thinning treatment;NPP;Trees,,

Two years of continuous measurements showed that net CO2 exchange varied among vegetation types, with the largest growing-season (Apr-Nov) net CO2 uptake on a per cover area basis from evergreen needleleaf trees (-603 g C m(-2)), followed by deciduous broadleaf trees (-216 g C m(-2)), irrigated turfgrass (-211 g C m(-2)), and non-irrigated turfgrass (-115 g C m(-2)).

Although trees planted by the MTLA program are likely to be a net CO2 sink, there is ample opportunity to reduce emissions. Examples of these opportunities include selecting drought-tolerant trees and utilizing wood residue to generate electricity rather than producing mulch.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,Carbon footprint;Carbon sequestration;Climate change;Life cycle inventory;Tree planting;Urban forestry;Urban trees;Carbon Dioxide;Trees,,

Drivers influencing wood waste yields and carbon (C) sequestration were analyzed as was accuracy of available urban tree C storage models. We estimated annual urban tree stem and crown biomass removals at 2 Mega grams (Mg) per hectare, equivalent to approximately 5\% of the annual requirements of a 100 MegaWatt bioenergy plant.

Its primary contribution is methodological; the derivation and application of urban tree canopy (UTC) based transfer functions (t C ha(-1) UTC). Findings for Los Angeles and Sacramento illustrate the complex role of regional and local determinants. Although average tree density and size were substantially greater in Los Angeles, the mean C storage density (8.15 t ha(-1)) was 53 percent of Sacramento's (15.4 t ha(-1)). In Sacramento, native oaks with very high wood densities (815 kg m(-3)) accounted for 30 percent of total basal area. In Los Angeles, the most dominant taxa had relatively low wood densities (350-550 kg m(-3)). The inclusion of relatively more wooded land in the Sacramento study area may partially explain higher C storage levels. In Los Angeles, where development is relatively dense, 14 percent of all trees surveyed shaded more than one building compared to only 2 percent in Sacramento. Consequently, the transfer function for avoided emissions in Los Angeles (2.77 t ha(-1) UTC yr(-1)) exceeded Sacramento (2.72 t ha(-1) UTC yr(-1)). The approach described here improves C estimates and increases the resolution at which C can be mapped across a region.

Using a 705 ha pine plantation that has been approved for the development of 1835 residential units near Gainesville, Florida, our objectives were to determine which site designs and tree preservation strategies could maximize carbon sequestration and storage. From 80 stratified random plots, we measured and analyzed tree and plot characteristics according to forest type and tree stand age categories.

Using ArcMap, we then assessed the impact, on baseline carbon sequestration and storage capacity, of several different site designs and tree conservation scenarios for the proposed development. Up to 91\% of carbon storage and up to 82\% of carbon sequestration could be maintained through a cluster urban development design and by preserving older tree stands.

The savings associated with these benefits vary by climate region and can be up to \$200 per tree. The cost of planting trees and maintaining them can vary from \$10 to \$500 per tree. Tree-planting programs can be designed to have lower costs so that they offer potential savings to communities that plant trees. Our calculations suggest that urban trees play a major role in sequestering CO, and thereby delay global warming. We estimate that a tree planted in Los Angeles avoids the combustion of 18 kg of carbon annually, even though it sequesters only 4.5-11 kg (as it would if growing in a forest). In this sense, one shade tree in Los Angeles is equivalent to three to five forest trees. In a recent analysis for Baton Rouge, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City, we estimated that planting an average of four shade trees per house (each with a top view cross section of 50 m(2)) would lead to an annual reduction in carbon emissions from power plants of 16,000, 41,000, and 9000 t, respectively (the per-tree reduction in carbon emissions is about 10-11 kg per year).

However, few studies have investigated the photosynthetic CO2 uptake potential of different urban tree species across seasons. In particular little is known about photosynthetic CO2 uptake in cities with a subtropical, oceanic climate where evergreen species are dominant. We addressed this shortcoming by measuring net photosynthetic rates of ten native and exotic tree species during different seasons and times of the day in Auckland, New Zealand. We also assessed the potential of leaf nitrogen (N) concentration as a proxy for net photosynthetic capacities of urban trees, which is of particular importance to upscale leaf-level photosynthetic CO2 uptake to local and regional scales. In addition, we compared measured net photosynthetic capacities (light-saturated net photosynthetic rates) with carbon (C) sequestration rates estimated using tree growth measurements and allometric equations. Mean net photosynthetic capacities ranged between 2.37 and 10.48 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) across all seasons and were closely related to tree C sequestration rates, suggesting that increased photosynthesis enhances growth rates and therefore tree C sequestration rates. Given that winter net photosynthetic capacities remained high in evergreen species (3.38-13.96 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), with almost 50\% higher mean net photosynthetic capacity compared to summer across all species, we suggest that tree planting programmes for CO2 mitigation should favour long living evergreen tree species with high basal area increments (BAI). Leaf N explained 43\% and 57\% of the variability of photosynthetic capacities across species in summer and winter, respectively. These results indicate that leaf N may be used as a proxy for net photosynthetic capacities of commonly planted urban trees in Auckland. However, further research is required to provide robust models that may be used to estimate photosynthetic CO2 uptake at a local and urban scale.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Danielle""=>""Included""}",,Allometric equations;Carbon sequestration;Urban greening;Leaf-level gas exchange;Leaf nitrogen;New Zealand;Trees,,

The analysis was based on continuous measurements of tree growth, sap flow and meteorological characteristics along a transect of five sites of Tilia cordata and three sites of Robinia pseudoacacia spread over the urban area of Wurzburg, Germany. The biomass increment of both tree species was reduced up to 50 \% with respect to normal weather conditions, especially in the extreme drought year 2018. The studied tree species revealed contrasting growth strategies with T. cordata being more prone to droughts than R. pseudoacacia. Under drought conditions R. pseudoacacia showed twice as much carbon sequestration as T. cordata, which means that R. pseudoacacia is much more water use efficient than T. cordata. In drought years the water use efficiency increases up to 4.4 kg (kg H2O)(-1) for R. pseudoacacia, while it remains at 0.83-0.86 kg (kg H2O)(-1) for T. cordata. Whereas both species have shown substantially reduced transpiration rates in both years, T. cordata had a higher transpiration activity than R. pseudoacacia, Hence, T. cordata made a larger contribution to microclimatic cooling in drought and normal years.

Soils in urbanized landscapes experience a multitude of human alterations, such as compaction and management subsidies, that impact soil C dynamics. While field studies may provide data on urban soil C storage, modeling soil C dynamics under various human impact scenarios will provide a basis for identifying drivers of urban soil C dynamics and for predicting the potential for these highly altered soils to store C over time intervals not typically amenable to empirical validation. The goal of this study was to model soil C dynamics in residential lawns using CENTURY, a dynamic mechanistic model, to determine whether drivers of soil C dynamics in natural systems (e.g., soil texture) were equally useful for estimating soil C content of highly modified soils in urban residential areas. Without incorporating human impacts, we found no relationship between initial CENTURY model simulations and observed soil C (P>0.05). Factors that best explained soil C accumulation for the observed soil C (bulk density, r(2)=0.30; home age, r(2)=0.37; P<0.01) differed from those found important for the CENTURY model simulations (percent sand, r(2)=0.72, P<0.001). Therefore, we conducted a modeling exercise to test whether simulating potential construction disturbance and lawn management practices would improve modeled soil and tree C. We found that incorporating these factors did improve CENTURY's ability to model soil and tree C (P<0.001). The results from this analysis suggest that incorporating various human disturbances and management practices that occur in urban landscapes into CENTURY model runs will improve its ability to predict urban soil C dynamics, at least within a 100-yr time frame.

We used historical archival sources and land-cover data to quantify and map historical tree carbon storage in the now-urban Santa Clara Valley, California, USA prior to substantial Euro-American modification (ca. 1850) and to analyze change in the amount and distribution of carbon storage over the past ca. 160 years. We estimate that total tree carbon storage in the study area was similar to 784,000 to 2.2 million Mg (13.6-38.1 Mg C/ha) when the region was characterized by oak savanna and woodland habitats, compared to similar to 895,000 Mg C (15.5 Mg C/ha) today. This represents a non-significant gain of 14\% to a significant loss of 60\% depending on scenario. We also demonstrate changes in the spatial distribution of carbon on the landscape, as losses in carbon storage in areas of former oak woodland were partially offset by gains in carbon storage in historical habitat types that historically had few or no trees.

One of the ways trees mitigate impacts of climate change is by absorbing carbon dioxide and storing carbon in their wood, leaves, roots, and soil. Field assessments are used to quantify the carbon storage across different forested landscapes. The number of trees, their size, and total area inform estimates of how much carbon they store. Urban forested natural areas often have greater tree density compared to trees planted in designed cityscapes suggesting that natural area forests could be an important carbon stock for cities. We report a carbon budget for urban forested natural area using field-collected data across an entire city and model carbon stock and annual stock change in multiple forest pools. We find that natural area forests in New York City store a mean of 263.04 (95\% CI 256.61, 270.40) Mg C ha(-1) and we estimate that 1.86 Tg C (95\% CI 1.60, 2.13 Tg C) is stored in the city's forested natural areas. We provide an upper estimate that these forests sequester carbon at a mean rate of 7.42 (95\% CI 7.13, 7.71) Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) totaling 0.044 Tg (95\% CI 0.028, 0.055) of carbon annually, with the majority being stored in trees and soil. Urban forested natural areas store carbon at similar and in some cases higher rates compared to rural forests. Native oak-dominated forests with large mature trees store the most carbon. When compared to previous estimates of urban-canopy carbon storage, we find that trees in natural area forests in New York City account for the majority of carbon stored despite being a minority of the tree canopy.

In addition, the carbon storage of soils is often excluded. Also the implications for planning require more attention.

The research is based on a case study in Helsinki, Finland, and applies i-Tree planting tool to assess the current and potential life cycle CSS of the case area. The results reveal that trees and the mixing of biochar into growing medium can increase the CSS considerably. The CSS potential of the case area is 520 kg CO2 per resident during 50 years. The added biochar accounts for 65 \% of the capacity and the biomass of trees accounts for 35 \%. At the city scale, it would lead to 330 000 t CO2 being stored during 50 years.

This study aims to determine how landcover characteristics influence the amount of carbon (C) sequestered and respired via biological processes, evaluating the role of land management on the overall C budget of an urban university. Boston University published a comprehensive Climate Action Plan in 2017 with the goal of achieving C neutrality by 2040. In this study, we digitized and discretized each of Boston University's three urban campuses into landcover types, with C sequestration and respiration rates measured and scaled to provide a University-wide estimate of biogenic C fluxes within the broader context of total University emissions. Results: Each of Boston University's three highly urban campuses were net sources of biogenic C to the atmosphere. While trees were estimated to sequester 0.6 +/- 0.2 kg C m(-2) canopy cover year(-1), mulch and lawn areas in 2018 emitted C at rates of 1.7 +/- 0.4 kg C m(-2) year(-1) and 1.4 +/- 0.4 kg C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. C uptake by tree canopy cover, which can spatially overlap lawn and mulched landcovers, was not large enough to offset biogenic emissions. The proportion of biogenic emissions to Scope 1 anthropogenic emissions on each campus varied from 0.5\% to 2\%, and depended primarily on the total anthropogenic emissions on each campus. Conclusions: Our study quantifies the role of urban landcover in local C budgets, offering insights on how landscaping management strategies-such as decreasing mulch application rates and expanding tree canopy extent-can assist universities in minimizing biogenic C emissions and even potentially creating a small biogenic C sink. Although biogenic C fluxes represent a small fraction of overall anthropogenic emissions on urban university campuses, these biogenic fluxes are under active management by the university and should be included in climate action plans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,Climate action plan;Urban carbon cycling;Landscaping;Biogenic fluxes;Soil respiration;Nature-based solution,,

A 41-year period (1976-2017) of the street trees along the sidewalks of the Tianliao river in Keelong city in Taiwan was taken a case study. The results showed that planting street trees helps mitigate climate change by reducing total GHG emissions (15 661 t CO2-eq) and producing an amount of renewable energy (5.9x106 kWh), that is around 1\% of the renewable energy generated by 24 waste-to-energy plants in Taiwan. The GHG mitigation during the lifespans of street trees can efficiently compensate for the GHG emissions that occur during end-of-life treatment (including both incineration and composting). On average, around 40 t CO2-eq of GHG mitigation would be achieved by planting a street tree. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that US\$223 992 were saved over the study period due to the reduction in carbon tax achieved by the mitigation of GHGs.

However, the ecosystem functions that generate these services, such as biomass carbon (C) uptake, can differ substantially from nearby rural forest. In particular, the scaled effect of canopy spatial configuration on tree growth in cities is uncertain, as is the scope for medium-term policy intervention. This study integrates high spatial resolution data on tree canopy and biomass in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, with local measurements of tree growth rates to estimate the magnitude and distribution of annual biomass C uptake. We further project C uptake, biomass, and canopy cover change to 2040 under alternative policy scenarios affecting the planting and preservation of urban trees. Our analysis shows that 85\% of tree canopy area was within 10 m of an edge, indicating essentially open growing conditions. Using growthmodels accounting for canopy edge effects and growth context, Boston's current biomass C uptake may be approximately double (median 10.9GgC yr(-1), 0.5 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1)) the estimates based on rural forest growth, much of it occurring in high-density residential areas. Total annual C uptake to long-term biomass storage was equivalent to <1\% of estimated annual fossil CO2 emissions for the city. In built-up areas, reducing mortality in larger trees resulted in the highest predicted increase in canopy cover (+25\%) and biomass C stocks (236 GgC) by 2040, while planting trees in available road margins resulted in the greatest predicted annual C uptake (7.1 GgC yr(-1)). This study highlights the importance of accounting for the altered ecosystem structure and function in urban areas in evaluating ecosystem services. Effective municipal climate responses should consider the substantial fraction of total services performed by trees in developed areas, which may produce strong but localized atmospheric C sinks.

To reach a maximum contribution to well-being in cities, the urban regulating ecosystem services (URES) must match with the demands in terms of space and time. If we understand the matches or mismatches between the current urban dwellers' desired quality conditions (demand) and the supply of URES by urban forests (UF) in the cities, this will facilitate integrating the concepts of ecosystem services in urban planning and management, but such an assessment has suffered from major knowledge limitations. Since it is complex and problematic to identify the direct demands for URES and the spatiotemporal patterns therein, improving the demand indicators can help to determine the actual requirements. In this paper, a methodological approach based on indicators is presented and demonstrated for two important URES: air quality improvement and global climate change mitigation provided by urban trees and shrubs. Four air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets were used and compared to supplies of the URES in Tabriz, Iran. Our results show that the mean contribution of the URES supply to air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets is modest. Hence, in Tabriz, there is a strong mismatch between demand and supply. Mismatches at the city scale will have to be reduced by both a reduction in pollutant emissions and an increased provisioning of URES supply through urban greenery. The presented assessment approach and the results for Tabriz make it explicit how different the demands and supplies of the two studied URES are, and we expect similar mismatches in many other cities. Therefore, our approach, relatively simple but still realistic and easy-to-apply, can raise awareness about, and the utility of, the ecosystem services concepts for urban planning and policymaking.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,"",,

We surveyed homeowners, who selected their most preferred front yard and backyard from a series of images and indicated what characteristics were important to their preferences. We developed a homeowner typology based on their stated preferences for more and less wooded front yards and backyards, distinguished each type by landscape characteristics that were most important to homeowners, and tested whether homeowners of each preference type managed their actual yards consistent with type. Our results show that homeowners are heterogeneous in their preferences, identifying different characteristics as important according to type, but that only mowing of their actual yard is consistent with type.

Using a case study of Lisbon, Portugal from 2008 to 2016, we illustrate a combined use of an urban energy metabolism assessment coupled with a logarithmic mean Divisia index to isolate the changes in energy-related carbon emissions associated with policy changes. We then link these energy flows to life cycle emissions factors to build a multi-level assessment between local and non-local global warming potential. We find that in 2016 Lisbon's energy flows generated more than 2 Mt of CO2-equivalent emissions over their life cycles, 48\% of which were direct emissions within the city. This corresponds to a decrease of around 37\% in greenhouse gas emissions from 2008. Additionally, we estimate the potential of Lisbon's urban forests to sequester these emissions to understand the potential for climate change mitigation. Results show that Lisbon's urban forest can meet less than 1\% of the emissions throughout the assessment period.

This concern has evoked interest in the potential for urban greenspace to help reduce the levels of atmospheric carbon. This study quantifies greenspace-related carbon storage and annual carbon fluxes for urban residential landscapes. For detailed quantification, the scale of this study was limited to two residential blocks in northwest Chicago which had a significant difference in vegetation cover. Differences between the two blocks in the size of greenspace area and vegetation cover resulted in considerable differences in total carbon storage and annual carbon uptake. Total carbon storage in greenspace was about 26.15 kg/m(2) of greenspace in study block 1, and 23.20 k/m(2) of greenspace in block 2. Of the total, soil carbon accounted for approximately 78.7\% in block 1 and 88.7\% in block 2. Trees and shrubs in block 1 and block 2 accounted for 20.8\% and 10.6\%, respectively. The carbon storage in grass and other herbaceous plants was approximately 0.5-0.7\% in both blocks. Total net annual carbon input to the study blocks by all the greenspace components was in the region of 0.49 kg/m(2) of greenspace in block 1 and 0.32 kg/m(2) of greenspace in block 2. The principal net carbon release from greenspaces of the two residential landscapes was from grass maintenance. Greenspace planning and management strategies were explored to minimize carbon release and maximize carbon uptake.

Six house lots were examined in each of three age-categories of residential neighborhoods (>80 years, 30-50 years, and <10 years), and these were compared to four forested plots in semi-natural urban parks and four in a natural forest. The residential areas represented broad stages of successional development of ``urban forest,{''} while the stands of semi-natural and natural forest are representative of the original habitats that have been converted into residential land-use. In general, the observed plant species richness was much higher in the residential areas, but these habitats were strongly dominated by non-indigenous species whereas the natural and semi-natural habitats supported native taxa. This obvious difference between residential areas and semi-natural/natural habitats was confirmed by cluster analysis and principal components analysis, both of which separated the sample sites into two groups of plant communities. Neighborhood age and proximity of the residential sites had little influence on these multivariate analyses, suggesting that site-specific management practices (such as horticultural choices of landowners) had a strong influence on plant-community structure. Woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) in the semi-natural and natural forest had a higher basal area and stored more biomass and carbon than in residential habitats. However, there was a successional progression in the urban forest, in that older habitats stored much more woody carbon than younger ones. Although well-vegetated residential neighborhoods provide important environmental services, their striking dominance by exotic species, as well as their lower carbon Storage in vegetation, contribute to an impoverishment of ecological integrity. This circumstance could be partially mitigated by changing horticultural management to encourage naturalization, particularly through the planting of indigenous species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The main objectives of this study were to quantify the C storage of urban forests in Changchun City, Northeast China and understand the effects of forest type and urbanization on C storage of urban forests. The results showed that the mean C density and the total C storage of urban forests in Changchun were 4.41 kg/m(2) and 4.74 x 10(8) kg, respectively. There were significant differences in C density among urban forest types. Landscape and relaxation forest (LF) had the highest C density with 5.41 kg/m(2), while production and management forest (PF) had the lowest C density with 1.46 kg/m(2). These differences demonstrate that urban forest type is an important factor needed to be considered when the C storage is accurately estimated. Further findings revealed significant differences in different gradients of urbanization, and the mean C density decreased from the first ring (6.99 kg/m(2)) to the fourth ring (2.87 kg/m(2)). The total C storage increased from the first ring to the third ring. These results indicate that C storage by urban forests will be significantly changed during the process of urbanization.

Using i-Tree Eco software and its sampling and data collection protocol, an assessment of the baseline condition, ecological function, and value of the urban forests in Scotlandville (Louisiana, USA) was conducted during 2014. A stratified (by land use type) random sample plot map of the town was generated. Data from 170 field plots located throughout Scotlandville were collected, including tree species, diameter at breast height, total tree height, height to live top, height to crown base, crown width, crown dieback, crown light exposure, percent impervious surface under the tree, and direction and distance to building. Data were then entered into i-Tree Eco v5.0 and analyzed. Modeling results indicated that there are a total of 31 species and an estimated 239,000 trees in Scotlandville with a tree canopy cover of 23.7 percent; the three most common species are Black willow (Salix nigra), Water oak (Quercus nigra), and American elm (Ulmus americana); the overall tree density is 77 trees per hectare and trees with diameters of more than 15 cm (6 inches) constitute 56.5\% of the population. The model estimated that annually, the urban forests in Scotlandville remove 96 tons of air pollutants; gross sequestration is about 3,880 tons of carbon and net carbon sequestration is about 3,650 tons. Each year, trees in Scotlandville are estimated to store 88,700 tons of carbon, produce 9,720 tons of oxygen, reduce runoff by 121,200 m(3), reduce energy-related costs by \$324,000 USD, and provide an additional \$52,595 in value by reducing the amount of carbon released by power plants (a reduction of 739 tons of carbon emissions).

Urban populations have globally increased fivefold since 1950, and they disproportionately consume ecosystem services and contribute to carbon emissions, highlighting the need to increase urban sustainability and reduce environmental impacts of urban dwellers. Here, we investigated the potential for increasing carbon sequestration, and biomass fuel production, by planting trees and short-rotation coppice (SRC), respectively, in a mid-sized UK city as a contribution to meeting national commitments to reduce CO2 emissions. Iterative GIS models were developed using high-resolution spatial data. The models were applied to patches of public and privately owned urban greenspace suitable for planting trees and SRC, across the 73km(2) area of the city of Leicester. We modelled tree planting with a species mix based on the existing tree populations, and SRC with willow and poplar to calculate biomass production in new trees, and carbon sequestration into harvested biomass over 25years. An area of 11km(2) comprising 15\% of the city met criteria for tree planting and had the potential over 25years to sequester 4200tonnes of carbon above-ground. Of this area, 58km(2) also met criteria for SRC planting and over the same period this could yield 71800tonnes of carbon in harvested biomass. The harvested biomass could supply energy to over 1566 domestic homes or 30 municipal buildings, resulting in avoided carbon emissions of 29236tonnes of carbon over 25years when compared to heating by natural gas. Together with the net carbon sequestration into trees, a total reduction of 33419 tonnes of carbon in the atmosphere could be achieved in 25years by combined SRC and tree planting across the city.Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that urban greenspaces in a typical UK city are underutilized for provisioning ecosystem services by trees and especially SRC, which has high biomass production potential. For urban greenspace management, we recommend that planting SRC in urban areas can contribute to reducing food-fuel conflicts on agricultural land and produce renewable energy sources close to centres of population and demand.

In this study, we estimate size-specific growth, mortality, and planting rates in trees under municipal control, use a box model to forecast short-term changes in street tree aboveground carbon pools under several planting and management scenarios, and compare our findings to rural, forested systems. We find accelerated rates of carbon cycling in street trees with mean diameter growth rates nearly four times faster in Boston, MA, USA (0.78 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1)) than in rural forest stands of MA (0.21 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1)) and mean mortality rates more than double rural forested rates (3.06 +/- 0.25\% yr(-1) in street trees; 1.41 +/- 0.04\% yr(-1) in rural trees). Despite the enhanced growth of urban trees, high mortality losses result in a net loss of street tree carbon storage over time (-0.15 +/- 0.09 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Planting initiatives alone may not be sufficient to maintain or enhance canopy cover and biomass due to the unique demographics of urban ecosystems. Initiatives to aid in the establishment and preservation of tree health are central for increasing street tree canopy cover and maintaining/increasing carbon storage in vegetation.

In achieving the SDGs, green urban areas (GUA) play a fundamental role at the local level as they provide recreational and bioclimatic regulatory functions and act as a carbon sink, as well. Specifically, the GUAs contribute directly to three SDGs: SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 13 Climate Action and SDG 15 Life on land. This paper evaluates direct contribution of GUA to this SDGs with high spatial resolution in the case study of the city of Valencia (Spain). The evaluation carried out has made it possible to make a diagnosis of the quantity and accessibility of GUA at sub-neighbourhood level. The results for SDG 11 show that only 9.23\% of the population do not have desirable access to GUA and 2.73\% live in areas without easy walking distance access to GUA. On the other hand, the evaluation of SDG 15 shows that each inhabitant has at their disposal 10 m2 of GUA, below the average of cities of more than 250,000 inhabitants in Spain. The high spatial resolution of the evaluation has also made it possible to identify the city areas with the worst access to GUA and the least amount of GUA per inhabitant. In consequence, the results allow determining zones with high potential to improve. Additionally, the quantification of the CO2 fixed by the GUA carried out for the evaluation of SDG 13, shows that the fixed carbon is equivalent to 0.04\% of total gross GHG emissions of the city and is 36\% higher than the total GHG emissions of the annual fuel consumption of the total fleet in the city.

The economic value of the annual carbon uptake, which was \$7.1million/yr, equaled 15.1\% of the annual maintenance budget of the parks in the city. However, the role of study parks as a source of carbon uptake was limited due to the distribution of large grass and impervious areas, the single-layered structures, and the dominance of small trees. Planning strategies were explored to enhance carbon reduction effects of the parks. They included the expansion of tree planting spaces through the minimization of unnecessary grass and paving areas, the active tree planting in the potential planting spaces, the multi-layered planting grouped with larger trees, and the planting of tree species having satisfactory growth rates.

Quantification of carbon (C) storage and sequestration by urban forests is critical for the assessment of the actual and potential role of urban forests in reducing atmospheric CO2. This paper provides a case study of the quantification of C storage and sequestration by urban forests in Shenyang, a heavily industrialized city in northeastern China. The C storage and sequestration were estimated by biomass equations, using field survey data and urban forests data derived from high-resolution QuickBird images. The benefits of C storage and sequestration were estimated by monetary values, as well as the role of urban forests on offsetting C emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The results showed that the urban forests in areas within the third-ring road of Shenyang stored 337,000t C (RMB92.02 million, or \$ 13.88 million), with a C sequestration rate of 29,000 t/yr (RMB7.88 million, or \$ 1.19 million). The C stored by urban forests equaled to 3.02\% of the annual C emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and C sequestration could offset 0.26\% of the annual C emissions in Shenyang. In addition, our results indicated that the C storage and sequestration rate varied among urban forest types with different species composition and age structure. These results can be used to help assess the actual and potential role of urban forests in reducing atmospheric CO2 in Shenyang. In addition, they provide insights for decision-makers and the public to better understand the role of urban forests, and make better management plans for urban forests.

We developed a very high resolution map of urban tree biomass, assessed the scale sensitivities in biomass estimation, compared our results with lower resolution estimates, and explored the demographic relationships in biomass distribution across the City of Boston. We integrated remote sensing data (including LiDAR-based tree height estimates) and field-based observations to map canopy cover and aboveground tree carbon storage at similar to 1 m spatial scale. Mean tree canopy cover was estimated to be 25.5 +/- 1.5\% and carbon storage was 355 Gg (28.8 Mg C ha(-1)) for the City of Boston. Tree biomass was highest in forest patches (110.7 Mg C ha(-1)), but residential (32.8 Mg C ha(-1)) and developed open (23.5 Mg C ha(-1)) land uses also contained relatively high carbon stocks. In contrast with previous studies, we did not find significant correlations between tree biomass and the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods, including income, education, race, or population density. The proportion of households that rent was negatively correlated with urban tree biomass (R-2 = 0.26, p = 0.04) and correlated with Priority Planting Index values (R-2 = 0.55, p = 0.001), potentially reflecting differences in land management among rented and owner-occupied residential properties. We compared our very high resolution biomass map to lower resolution biomass products from other sources and found that those products consistently underestimated biomass within urban areas. This underestimation became more severe as spatial resolution decreased. This research demonstrates that 1) urban areas contain considerable tree carbon stocks; 2) canopy cover and biomass may not be related to the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods; and 3) that recent advances in high resolution remote sensing have the potential to improve the characterization and management of urban vegetation.

However, very little research has been conducted on private property and little is known about the structure and function of privately owned urban forests. This research examines the structure of and carbon storage services provided by private residential urban forests in a moderate-sized Midwestern city. The primary research questions are as follows: What is the structure of private urban forests, and how does it vary across parcels? How much carbon is stored in tree and soil pools of private urban forests, and how does carbon vary across parcels? Ecological inventories were conducted on 100 residential parcels within 14 Neighborhood and Homeowners Associations of varying size and development age. Tree species richness, diversity, density, and diameter distribution were determined on a per parcel basis and for the entire tree population sampled. Further, tree and soil carbon storage were determined for each parcel. Results of this research demonstrated large variability in per-parcel tree metrics. Twelve of the parcels sampled had two or fewer trees, while eleven had greater than 50 trees. Further, tree carbon storage ranged from no carbon to 11.22 kg C m(-2). Alternatively, soil carbon storage was less variable and averaged 4.7 kg C m(-2), approximately 1.9 times higher than the average carbon stored in trees (2.5 kg C m(-2)). Management efforts aimed at maintaining or enhancing carbon storage and other ecosystem services should focus on both soil protection and maximizing services in living biomass. Our results demonstrate that sustaining tree-produced ecosystem services requires maintenance of large old trees and species diversity, not only in terms of relative abundance, but also relative dominance, and in combination, species-specific size distributions.

In this study, a detailed methodology for urban tree CS calibration and mapping was developed for the small urban area of Sassuolo in Italy. For dominant tree species classification, a remote sensing approach was applied, utilizing a high-resolution WV3 image. Five dominant species were identified and classified by applying the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach with an overall accuracy of 78\%. The CS calibration was done by utilizing an allometric model based on the field data of tree dendrometry-i.e., Height (H) and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). For geometric measurements, a terrestrial photogrammetric approach known as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) was utilized. Out of 22 randomly selected sample plots of 100 square meters (10 m x 10 m) each, seven plots were utilized to validate the results of the CS calibration and mapping.

Given the current situation of environmental problems and the basic geographical conditions of Xi'an City, this study evaluated and mapped four kinds of ecosystem services from the perspective of equity: biodiversity, carbon sequestration, air purification, and climate regulation. Regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning (REDCAP) was used to obtain the partition groups of ecosystem services. The results indicate that first, the complexity of the urban green space community is low, and the level of biodiversity needs to be improved. The dry deposition flux of particulate matter (PM2.5) decreases from north to south, and green spaces enhance the adsorption of PM2.5. Carbon sequestration in the south and east is higher than that in the north and west, respectively. The average surface temperature in green spaces is lower than that in other urban areas. Second, urban green space resources in the study area are unevenly distributed. Therefore, ecosystem services in different areas are inequitable. Finally, based on the regionalization of integrated ecosystem services, an ecosystem services cluster was developed. This included 913 grid spaces, 12 partitions, and 5 clusters, which can provide a reference for distinct levels of ecosystem services management. This can assist urban managers who can use these indicators of ecosystem service levels for planning and guiding the overall development pattern of green spaces.

In 1995, Taiwan's government began, via afforestation, to establish air quality enhancement zones (AQEZs) in order to promote multiple environmental benefits, including improved air quality, increased carbon sequestration, and enhanced environmental quality of life. In 2010, there were over 504 such zones. In addition to providing urban forests and green spaces, tree growth in AQEZs can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and, by shading and evapotranspiration, reduce energy demand and increase soil storage of organic carbon. In addition, afforestation can offset the carbon footprint of the world's population and is one of the best approaches to implementing carbon neutrality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the carbon reduction benefits of afforested AQEZs. Investigations of 48 AQEZs showed (1) a high diversity of trees planted (168 species), (2) an average density of trees of 1142/ha, (3) a forest timber volume of 23.92 m(3)/ha, lower than in standard plantations, (4) a carbon storage capacity of 9.25 tons/ha, and (5) average annual carbon sequestration of 134 ton-C/ha/yr. Carbon sequestration by AQEZs in Taiwan, although not remarkably high, is nevertheless, along with other ecosystem services provided by AQEZs, a significant and direct benefit to the urban public. This study provides a reliable basis of measureable results with which decision makers can evaluate benefits of urban forest carbon sequestration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

They produce a large proportion of CO2 emissions, but they also sequester and store carbon in urban forests and green space. However, sequestration by urban green space is difficult to quantify and also involves emissions. The carbon footprint analysis is an established method for systematically quantifying carbon sinks and sources throughout the lifetime of goods and services. We applied this method to an urban green space project in Leipzig, Germany. To the best of our knowledge it is the first application in this field. We simulated carbon sequestration by growing trees and contrasted it with all related carbon sources, from construction and maintenance over the lifetime of 50 years. In addition, we explored alternative design and maintenance scenarios. Total net sequestration was predicted to be between 137 and 162 MgCO2 ha(-1). Park-like design and maintenance is less effective than forest-like design and maintenance. Much uncertainty is linked to tree growth and tree mortality. Increasing annual tree mortality from 0.5 to 4\% reduces sequestration by over 70\%. In conclusion, urban green space can act as a carbon sink and the design and maintenance have a strong influence on the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the long-term environmental performance of urban green space projects. Compared to emissions from people, the overall potential for carbon mitigation is limited, even in cities such as Leipzig with widely available space for new urban green space. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we analyse and compare the morphologies and sustainability potential of residential suburbs and their gardens in two case studies: Traditional-suburban and Modern-suburban in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Spatial distributions of land-cover patterns were estimated using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS). The four sustainability parameters measured were: roof rain water collection; local food (vegetable) production; energy and CO2 emission savings from clothes lines; and carbon benefits of onsite tree canopy cover. Outcomes suggest that land cover such as tree canopy cover and other permeable and impermeable surfaces in garden spaces can significantly impact on sustainability. Impermeable surface cover is higher in the Modern-suburban compared to the Traditional-suburban development. Traditional-suburban is more capable of supporting environmental and ecological functions through better connectivity of green spaces and availability of onsite land areas for local food production. Modern-suburban has more capacity for roof rainwater collection due to larger building roof sizes, provided there is planning for sufficient tank spaces in the design phases. These results identify specific characteristics of two suburban forms which could make positive contributions to suburban sustainability.

This was done by selecting the most appropriate tree species among a vast range of species based on their potential environmental function (both services and disservices) in Tabriz city, Iran. Also, three main planting scenarios (divided to six sub-scenarios) were developed so as to understand the long-term effectiveness of introducing the selected tree species in improving the environmental benefits (both urban forest structure and ES) in comparison with planting the existing tree species. The results indicate that regardless of the quantity of planting, the benefits of introducing the selected trees will be more than planting the existing species. Moreover, as the amount of the annual planting of the recommended species increases, so does the improvement in the projected tree characteristics and ES. This approach creates more opportunities which enable urban forest managers and policymakers to understand the importance of selecting the proper urban tree species when looking for a nature-based solution to promote the wellbeing of the urban population, to create more livable and ecologically sustainable cities and to mitigate urban environmental problems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Danielle""=>""Included""}",,Urban forestry;Ecosystem services approach;Environmental benefits;Disservices;Scenario planning;Evaluation;Trees,,

More specifically, we investigated the effects of management, vegetation type and time since construction on the amount of carbon stored in park trees and soil. We conducted two tree surveys and collected soil samples (0-90 cm) in constructed parks managed by the city of Helsinki. The estimated overall carbon density was approximately 130 t per park hectare, when the carbon stock of trees was 22 to 28 t ha(-1) and that of soil 104 t ha(-1) at the very least. The soil to tree carbon storage ratio varied from 7.1 to 7.5 for vegetated, pervious grounds and from 3.7 to 5.0 for entire park areas. The effects of park management and vegetation type could not be entirely separated in our data, but time was shown to have a distinct, positive effect on tree and soil carbon stocks.

To address this lack of information, we used field data of random plots located along an urban to rural gradient in Shanghai, China, region-specific biomass equations, and path analysis of commonly studied urban forest socioeconomic and ecological drivers to analyze their effects on above ground tree carbon storage. An urbanization index was also developed to quantitatively differentiate urban from peri-urban sites along the transect. Results show that in both urban and peri-urban forests, percent tree and shrub cover had a significant and positive effect on tree and shrub carbon, but tree and shrub density had an even greater effect. Further, tree and shrub species diversity had no effects on carbon storage, while the effects of species composition on tree and shrub carbon in urban forests was different from those in peri-urban areas. Peri-urban forests also exhibited a significant effect of percent tree and shrub cover on tree and shrub species diversity.

This paper provides a novel methodological approach to assess regulating ES mismatches on the basis of environmental quality standards and policy goals. Environmental quality standards (EQS) indicate the relationship between environmental quality and human well-being. Thus, they can be used as a common minimum threshold value to determine whether the difference between ES supply and demand is problematic for human well-being. The methodological approach includes three main steps: (1) selection of EQS, (2) definition and quantification of ES supply and demand indicators, and (3) identification and assessment of ES mismatches on the basis of EQS considering certain additional criteria. While ES supply indicators estimate the flow of an ES actually used or delivered, ES demand indicators express the amount of regulation needed in relation to the standard. The approach is applied to a case study consisting of five European cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm, Rotterdam and Salzburg, considering three regulating ES which are relevant in urban areas: air purification, global climate regulation and urban temperature regulation. The results show that levels of ES supply and demand are highly heterogeneous across the five studied cities and across the EQS considered. The assessment shows that ES supply contributes very moderately in relation to the compliance with the EQS in most part of the identified mismatches. Therefore, this research suggests that regulating ES supplied by urban green infrastructure are expected to play only a minor or complementary role to other urban policies intended to abate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at the city scale. The approach has revealed to be appropriate for the regulating ES air purification and global climate regulation, for which well-established standards or targets are available at the city level. Yet, its applicability to the ES urban temperature regulation has proved more problematic due to scale and user dependent constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand how urban trees are vital for carbon sink, the present study aimed to quantify the carbon density and CO(2)eq in trees at National Zoological Park (NZP), New Delhi, a tropical semi-arid region of India. For this, we estimated tree biomass or dry matter content of 25 species with the help of allometric equations which are available in published literature and applicable for the tropical region.

While it is essential to understand the temporal dynamics of urban forest structure as well as its services and contribution to human wellbeing in cities, it has hardly ever been examined whether the future contributions of these services after different possible planting strategies can comply with climate change policy goals; these are topics rarely discussed in urban planning and management. In this paper, the ecosystem services currently provided by urban trees (through carbon sequestration and storage), as well as those potentially provided in the future, were quantified using the i-Tree Eco model, and their contribution to climate change mitigation was evaluated. As a case study in Tabriz, Iran, we developed four possible scenarios. Synergy (urban temperature regulation by UF) and trade-off (tree water requirements) were also analyzed. Future carbon sequestration and storage potential of urban trees was compared with the estimated future carbon emissions. The current contribution in Tabriz is relatively modest (about 0.2\%), but it can be tripled through long-term tree planting strategies. Additionally, the temporal cooling effects and tree water requirements increase as climate change mitigation improves through tree planting. We conclude that urban tree planting has a small impact on carbon mitigation in the study area, most likely because of the young age of trees in Tabriz as well as the fact that the planted trees cannot deliver all their benefits over a 20-years period and need more time. Thus, the use of urban trees serves only as a complementary solution rather than an alternative climate mitigation strategy.

Field data were analyzed, modeled, and spatially analyzed to compare CO(2) sequestered by managing urban forests to equivalent amounts of CO(2) emitted in both urban areas. Urban forests in Gainesville have greater tree density, store more carbon and present lower per-tree sequestration rates than Miami-Dade as a result of environmental conditions and urbanization patterns.

After setting up the scope of the life cycle, the energy and material used for each stage were analyzed on the basis of field survey, design and construction details, and literature review of 30 study parks. The net carbon uptake per unit of park area averaged 8.51 kg/m(2), with urban parks playing an important role as a source of carbon uptake to mitigate the climate change. This study suggested ecological design and construction strategies including the expansion of tree planting spaces through the minimization of grass and impervious areas, the minimization of changes to existing topography, and the utilization of local materials. As a result of applying these strategies to study parks, the net carbon uptake increased approximately 9.2 times.

L. R. and Dupras, J.",,English,ELSEVIER GMBH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY","Cities are home to an increasing number of people who depend on urban forests to provide ecosystem services such as temperature regulation, air quality improvement and storm water abatement. Climate change may challenge the capacity of urban forests to provide these services. Intensification of heat waves, droughts and strengthening storms could lead to tree die-offs. In Quebec City, work has suggested that the urban canopy is vulnerable to future projected climates, i.e. hotter and drier summers. Compounding this threat, the exotic emerald ash borer is expected to kill 11 \% of municipal trees over the next decade. Together these pressures could lead to a significant loss of canopy cover and ecosystem service provisioning in the near-term. We test whether replanting strategies for lost ash, which shift the forest community towards a more climate tolerant canopy using a functional trait-based approach, can help to mitigate or improve ecosystem service provisioning in the near-term. Using a municipal database of urban trees, we simulate canopy growth and replacement over 20-years for three different replanting scenarios: i) `business-as-usual', ii) `stratified' or iii) `conifer-focused' replanting strategy, and compare their delivery of ecosystem services. Results from the simulations find clear trade-offs in ecosystem service provisioning within and between replanting approaches. The `conifer-focused' scenario provides the highest level of air quality improvement, storm water abatement and reduced energy demands in winter, however there are limitations on where coniferous trees can be planted in cities. In contrast, the `business-as-usual' scenario achieved greater canopy cover, carbon sequestration, and high summertime cooling, but remains vulnerable to climate change. Stratifying replanting across tree functional groups results in the greatest increase to canopy diversity, intermediate levels of ecosystem service provisioning and important reduction in vulnerability to future pests . We suggest that a replanting approach focused on increasing the functional trait diversity of the urban canopy will likely confer the greatest ecosystem service benefits to the urban population and improve the resilience of the urban canopy to pests and climate pressures in the future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,Urban forest;Climate change;Species composition;Functional diversity;Ecosystem services,,

Urban parks provide several ecosystem services that are valuable to the wellbeing of city-dwellers and they are also considered a nature-based solution to tackle multiple environmental problems in cities. However, the type and amount of ecosystem services provided will vary with each park vegetation type, even within same the park. Our main goal was to quantify the trade-offs in ecosystem services associated to different vegetation types, using a spatially detailed approach. Rather than relying solely on general vegetation typologies, we took a more ecologically oriented approach, by explicitly considering different units of vegetation structure and composition. This was demonstrated in a large park (44 ha) located in the city of Almada (Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal), where six vegetation units were mapped in detail and six ecosystem services were evaluated: carbon sequestration, seed dispersal, erosion prevention, water purification, air purification and habitat quality. The results showed that, when looking at the park in detail, some ecosystem services varied greatly with vegetation type. Carbon sequestration was positively influenced by tree density, independently of species composition. Seed dispersal potential was higher in lawns, and mixed forest provided the highest amount of habitat quality. Air purification service was slightly higher in mixed forest, but was high in all vegetation types, probably due to low background pollution, and both water purification and erosion prevention were high in all vegetation types. Knowing the type, location, and amount of ecosystem services provided by each vegetation type can help to improve management options based on ecosystem services trade-offs and looking for win-win situations. The trade-offs are, for example, very clear for carbon: tree planting will boost carbon sequestration regardless of species, but may not be enough to increase habitat quality. Moreover, it may also negatively influence seed dispersal service. Informed practitioners can use this ecological knowledge to promote the role of urban parks as a nature-based solution to provide multiple ecosystem services, and ultimately improve the design and management of the green infrastructure. This will also improve the science of Ecosystem Services, acknowledging that the type of vegetation matters for the provision of ecosystem services and trade-offs analysis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kayleigh""=>""Included""}",,Ecosystem services;Urban parks;Spatially detailed;Land management;Vegetation type;Eyeglasses;Ecosystem,,

The selection of hedge types characterized by different traits can be suggested for urban greening projects to decrease pollution levels. At this end, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and noise attenuation capability were analyzed in the following hedge types: Laurus nobilis, Nerium oleander, Pittosporum tobira and Pyracantha coccinea, largely used as green infrastructure in Rome (Italy). Representative hedges for each species were selected from high level traffic streets in the city centre (P sites). Traffic density (TD) was monitored simultaneously with CO2 concentration and noise level (N) in each of the considered P sites. The monthly CO2 sequestration capability (MSC) was calculated multiplying the total photosynthesis per hedge by the total photosynthetic activity time (in hours) per month. The multiple regression analysis predicted noise attenuation (Delta N) by a linear combination of total leaf area (TLA), total leaf density (TLD) and leaf mass area (LMA) of the considered hedge types. All the considered species, being evergreens, were active all year long, including winter, when CO2 emissions from road transport peaked. Nevertheless, among the considered hedge types, P. tobira and L. nobilis were the most efficient species in both MSC (31.6 +/- 2.8 and 25.4 +/- 2.4 kg CO2 month(-1), respectively) and Delta N (15 +/- 1%, mean value). The results give insight on the use of hedges to mitigate pollution effects. Moreover, this method can be used to monitor hedge contribution to air quality, in relation to various elements in the city (i.e. traffic density, new cars produced, application of management projects, local laws). These results might be available for projects based on the use of vegetation in order to improve environmental quality in urban areas.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Danielle""=>""Included""}",,CO2 sequestration;evergreen species;hedge;noise attenuation;urban area;ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE;URBAN FORESTS;REDUCTION;EMISSIONS;DIOXIDE;CITY;CO2;VEGETATION;STORAGE;FLUXES,,

Industrial energy use C emissions were estimated by accounting for fossil fuel use and assigning C emission factors. Total C storage by Hangzhou's urban forests was estimated at 11.74 Tg C, and C storage per hectare was 30.25 t C. Carbon sequestration by urban forests was 1,328,166.55 t C/year, and C sequestration per ha was 1.66 t C/ha/year. Carbon emissions from industrial energy use in Hangzhou were 7 Tg C/year. Urban forests, through sequestration, annually offset 18.57% of the amount of carbon emitted by industrial enterprises, and store an amount of C equivalent to 1.75 times the amount of annual C emitted by industrial energy uses within the city.

This study compared the carbon content of nine in ground and three green roof landscape systems of varying complexity to determine their carbon sequestration potential. Soil or substrate samples were analyzed prior to planting in 2009 and soil/substrate, below- and above-ground biomass were analyzed at the end of the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons.

Thus, spatially explicit information on net primary productivity (NPP) of reforested trees in urban environments is central to understanding the value of reforestation initiatives in the global carbon budget and climate regulation potential. To date, numerous studies have mainly focused on natural and commercial forests NPP at a regional scale based on coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed data. Generally, local scale NPP studies based on fine spatial resolution data are limited. Therefore, this study sought to estimate aboveground NPP of an urban reforested landscape using biophysical and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager data derived variables. Using the MOD17 model, results showed that mean NPP ranged between 6.24 Mg C ha(-1) with high coefficient of determination (R-2 : 0.92) and low RMSE (0.82 Mg ha(-1)) across all reforested trees within the study area. Results also showed a considerable variation in NPP among the reforested trees, with deciduous Acacia and Dalbergia obovate species showing the highest NPP (7.62 Mg C ha(-1) and 7.58 Mg C ha(-1)) respectively), while the evergreen Syzygium cordatum and shrub Artemisia afro had the lowest NPP (4.54 Mg C ha(-1) and 526 Mg C ha(-1)). Furthermore, the multiple linear regression analysis showed that vegetation specific biophysical variables (i.e. leaf area index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation) significantly improved the estimation of reforested aboveground NPP at a fine-scale resolution. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of biophysical and remotely sensed variables in determining NPP (as carbon sequestration surrogate) at fine-scaled reforested urban landscape.

A new comprehensive ecosystem service (CES) index was developed to reflect the comprehensive level of ESs. Associated with the influential factors, we simulated the business as usual scenario in 2030. Four alternative scenarios, including more compact growth (MCG), riparian vegetation buffer (RVB), soil conservation (SC), and combined development (CD) scenarios were developed to explore the optimal land use strategies which can enhance the ESs. The results showed that forest and wetland had the greatest decreases, while low and high intensity built-up lands had the greatest increases. The values of CES and most of ESs decreased significantly due to the sprawling expansion of built-up land. The scenario analysis revealed that the CD scenario performs best in CES value, while it performs the worst in food supply. Compared with the RVB and SC scenarios, MCG scenario is a more optimal land use strategy to enhance the ESs without at the expense of food supply. To integrate multiple ESs into land use planning and decision making, corresponding land management policies and ecological engineering measures should be implemented to enhance: (1) the water yield and water purification in urban core counties, (2) the carbon storage, habitat quality, and recreational opportunity in counties around the core area, and (3) the soil conservation and food supply in surrounding suburban counties.

We quantified urban ecosystem contributions to C stocks in the Boston (Massachusetts, USA) Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) using several alternative urban definitions. Development altered aboveground and belowground C and N stocks, and the sign and magnitude of these changes varied by land use and development intensity. Aboveground biomass (live trees, dbh >= 5 cm) for the MSA was 7.2 +/- 0.4 kg C/m(2) (mean +/- SE), reflecting a high proportion of forest cover. Vegetation C was highest in forest (11.6 +/- 0.5 kg C/m(2)), followed by residential (4.6 +/- 0.5 kg C/m(2)), and then other developed (2.0 +/- 0.4 kg C/m(2)) land uses. Soil C (0-10 cm depth) followed the same pattern of decreasing C concentration from forest, to residential, to other developed land uses (4.1 +/- 0.1, 4.0 +/- 0.2, and 3.3 +/- 0.2 kg C/m(2), respectively). Within a land use type, urban areas (which we defined as >25% impervious surface area [ISA] within a 1-km(2) moving window) generally contained less vegetation C, but slightly more soil C, than nonurban areas. Soil N concentrations were higher in urban areas than nonurban areas of the same land use type, except for residential areas, which had similarly high soil N concentrations. When we compared our definition of urban to other commonly used urban extents (U. S. Census Bureau, Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project [GRUMP], and the MSA itself), we found that urban soil (1 m depth) and vegetation C stocks spanned a wide range, from 14.4 +/- 0.8 to 54.5 +/- 3.4 Tg C and from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 27.3 +/- 3.2 Tg C, respectively. Conclusions about the importance of urban soils and vegetation to regional C and N stocks are very sensitive to the definition of urban used by the investigators. Urban areas, regardless of definition, are rapidly expanding in their extent; a systematic understanding of how our development patterns influence ecosystems is necessary to inform future development choices.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  77     Total Times Cited:  78     Cited Reference Count:  98 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Danielle""=>""Included""}",,"biomass;Boston, Massachusetts, USA;carbon;development;forest;impervious surface area;nitrogen;residential land use;scale;soil;urban definition;urbanization;LAND-COVER DATABASE;SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON;ATMOSPHERIC CO2;LONG-TERM;UNITED-STATES;NEW-YORK;BIOMASS;TREE;URBANIZATION;RETENTION;Nitrogen",,

With an appropriate selection of vegetation species, these corridors can be used to offset carbon emissions from railway operations. Simultaneously, the plantings will improve air quality, reduce pollution and storm water flows, ameliorate urban heating deliver biodiversity gains and improve urban design and property values. A pilot study was carried out on a representative section of one of the major rail lines in Sydney in 2016. A detailed inventory of vegetation on the selected site was obtained through a field survey and a variety of tools were used including i-Tree Eco to benchmark current carbon sequestration and storage (CS&S) levels. Study outcomes include the existing carbon capacity of the rail corridor's above-ground (and substrate) biomass and air pollution reduction. It also presents estimates of CS&S potential by identifying future planting areas within the pilot study corridor. These results are valuable for infrastructure policy formulation directed towards carbon emissions as well as securing the co-benefits noted above. (C) 2017 The Authors.
