The findings are as follows: (1) In the past two decades, the area of cropland and grassland has decreased; the area of water bodies, urban and rural, industrial and mining, and residential areas has increased; the area of forestland has increased first and then decreased. (2) The two major types of landscapes, cropland and grassland, are clearly being replaced by two land types, forest land and water bodies.

LUCC modeling is an important approach to\nunderstanding what has happened in the landscape and what may change in the future. Moreover,\nprospective modeling can provide sustainable and efficient decision support for land planning and\nenvironmental management. This paper modeled the LUCCs between 1996, 2001 and 2006 in the\nLISW in the New England region, which experienced an increase in developed area and a decrease of\nforest. The low-density development pattern played an important role in the loss of forest and the\nexpansion of urban areas.

The monitoring of trees is usually done with LiDAR data or multi and hyperspectral images. In this sense, remote sensing RGB images are presented as a cheaper and easier processing solution. Here, we proposed to evaluate deep learning-based methods combined with high-resolution RGB images to detect single-trees in the urban environment. Three state-of-the-art methods are tested: Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, and ATSS. A total of 220 images were used, in which we manually labeled 3382 trees. For the proposal task, our findings show that ATSS is 3% more accurate than Faster-RCNN and 4% than RetinaNet. However, in a qualitative inspection, Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet seems to be better at this task. Our findings shows the need of further research for developing suitable tools for urban tree detection.
