Crops grown in the study area include grains, vegetable crops, berries (including cranberries), and fruit trees and include both perennial and annual vegetation as well as the annually harvested crop.

According to Boyle and others (1995a) these older trees, containing almost 50% of the biomass of the forest in the LFB, occupied only 19% of the forested area in the LFB. loss of carbon from this pool also indicates that the higher carbon uptake of younger trees does not compensate for the mass of carbon lost through logging the old-growth timber. Once mobilized, less than 10% of forest biomass enters another stable, terrestrial carbon pool. Most of it is converted to carbon dioxide. The two major biomass sinks in buildings and urban areas lie in vegetation and residential buildings.

The primary source of the released carbon was old-growth forest, which contains a higher biomass per hectare than tropical rain forest (Ryan 1994). This forest was a major pool of carbon, and the release of this contained carbon is not being reversed by current forest management practices since trees are cut at a younger age. Moreover, the loss of carbon from soils after deforestation is also not being reversed and the other Figure 8. Biomass carbon in the LFB prior to 1827, in 1930, and in 1990. Figure 9.

Interestingly, established sage scrub and the transitional habitat did not differ in total stored C or N, indicating that partially grassinvaded sage scrub is much more similar to intact sage scrub than to type-converted grassland in terms of C and N storage. Our measurements show that sage scrub and transitional habitats store 4.3 kg C m2 and 4.1 kg C m2 on average, respectively, while grasslands store 1.9 kg C m2 on average.

(1) that natural lands should be protected and their ecosystem service contributions considered and included in land-use decision-making processes. Continued non-development on these lands will not increase current baseline costs. However, sustainable management practices to optimize ecological and ecosystem service outcomes will incur additional costs and/or reallocation of funds or person hours.
(2) we recommend continual land management and restoration to enhance biosequestration potentials, with targeted restoration projects in habitats with the greatest potentials (e.g. wetlands). Though important to note that natural landholdings warrant protection and conservation in their own right, these sites provide a myriad of ecosystem services valued at over $250m/yr. Specifically, the ecosystem services accounted for in total valuation include: regulating services (e.g. biosequestration of carbon, air quality and climate regulation), habitat (e.g. gene pool protection), provisioning services (e.g. raw materials and genetic resources) and cultural services (e.g. recreation) (de Groot et al., 2012; Costanza et al.,2014).

Correlations between observed and modeled carbon storage varied across sampling sites and urbanization levels. All models underestimated carbon storage. Carbon storage estimated by Method 1 most closely matched actual carbon storage for all sites and was not significantly different from them (p > 0.1). The distribution of carbon values in both Method 2 maps differed significantly from actual estimates (p < 0.001). We find that carbon storage ES mapping based on ecosystem components (i.e., trees, lawn) rather than LUC proxies provides estimates that closely match actual storage. Although both methods produced similar city-wide estimates of total carbon storage, estimates disagreed regarding the spatial distribution and magnitude of carbon storage at sub-municipal scales. Thus, while LUC-proxies may accurately estimate ES delivery in relatively homogeneous landscapes, they may be inappropriate in heterogeneous settings. Maps based on coarse resolution data showed less correspondence with actual carbon storage estimates at the aggregated landscape and pixel levels than maps based on finer-resolution LUC data. In our analyses, LUC proxies significantly underestimated ES provision in medium-density developed areas.",Y,Management,Management,N/A,N/A,"Our results suggest that, where coarse, study-area wide ES estimates provide adequate support for municipal policy and decision making, LUC-proxy based methods should provide sufficient accuracy, although this will vary with the precision required for decision making. However, for management or policy decisions requiring fine-resolution ES distribution information or for target services that are strongly influenced by landscape configuration, LUC proxies are less appropriate. Our analysis demonstrates that local ES map accuracy is highly dependent on analytical scale and input data. These factors should be considered carefully in producing and using ES maps to support municipal decision making. Since ES supply is inherently scale-dependent and site-specific, ES mapping aimed at supporting local decision making should use high-resolution data as much as possible, particularly where landscapes are highly heterogeneous and decision making involves spatial prioritization.",,EC

In Los Angeles, 370 plots were measured by a US Forest Service forester and UC Riverside graduate student during 2007 and 2008, with information recorded for 696 trees. Twenty-one of these plots were excluded from this analysis because they fell in non-urbanized areas. In Sacramento, 300 plots were measured by volunteers trained by the Sacramento Tree Foundation (STF) during 2007 and data recorded on 640 trees. Field data were obtained from STF and UC Riverside personnel after internal quality control was conducted. . All live trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) that exceeded 2.54 cm were measured with a tape to the closest 0.1 cm. Tree height was measured with a clinometer to the closest 0.1 m. In Sacramento, ocular estimation and plot mapping were used to calculate the percentages of plot area in tree cover, shrub cover under tree cover and shrub cover extending beyond tree cover. In Los Angeles, the percentage of shrub cover extending beyond tree cover was not recorded directly. It was calculated as the difference between total shrub cover and shrub cover under tree cover.","Above-ground biomass, Below-ground biomass","The two types of allometric biomass equations used in the CTCC yielded aboveground volume and dry weight of a tree. The methodology to convert green volume into biomass and eventually to stored C is well established (Jenkins, Chojnacky, Heath, & Birdsey, 2003a; Jenkins, Chojnacky, Heath, & Birdsey, 2003b; Markwardt & Wilson, 1935; Simpson, 1993) and entailed calculating total dry weight biomass, then carbon (C) and stored C equivalents. Converting the fresh weight of green volume into dry weight required use of species specific dry weight density conversion factors. The amount of belowground biomass in roots of urban trees is not well researched. This study assumed that root biomass was 28 percent of total tree biomass (Cairns, Brown, Helmer, & Baumgardner, 1997; Husch, Miller, & Beers, 1982; Wenger, 1984). Wood volume (dry weight) was converted to C by multiplying by the constant 0.50 (Lieth, Lieth, & Whittaker, 1975).

Storage densities ranged from 1.34 (CI) to 14.82 (LDR) t ha−1 in Los Angeles and 3.39 (CI) to 21.51 t ha−1 (LDR) in Sacramento. The overall average storage density in Sacramento (15.40 t ha−1) was about twice the amount in Los Angeles (8.15 t ha−1). The overall average annual sequestration density value was greater in Sacramento (0.90 t ha−1 yr−1) than Los Angeles (0.45 t ha−1 yr−1). Sequestration densities were lowest in CI land uses and relatively high in LDR uses. In Sacramento, the highest sequestration densities were in OS/PL and Agriculture. Los Angeles’ and Sacramento’s overall average annual avoided C emission densities were 0.38 and 0.50 t ha−1 yr−1, respectively.

In fact the total number of mature trees ranged from 19.8 trees/ha in urban estates, to 30.2 trees/ha in suburban estates, including trees within the communal playground area, thereby increasing the estates’ contribution to above-ground carbon storage and climate regulation.

We analyzed these data using SPSS 20 and 21. We grouped respondents according to their preferred yard styles.,2011,2011,N,Patch,"Respondents reported on several management behaviors that would affect carbon storage in their own yards (Table 5). However, only one of these behaviors varied significantly among those who preferred different yard styles: the proportion of their property that was mown lawn (Fisher’s Exact Test = 12.655, p < 0.05, n = 109). Consistent with their yard style, those who preferred a more wooded front yard (OWS and TTS) were more likely to mow less than half of their actual yard. Our study suggests that suburban homeowners are heterogeneous in their preferences for wooded yards. This finding is consistent with investigations of urban tree preferences elsewhere (Boone et al., 2010; Jones, Davis, & Bradford, 2013; Pearce, Davison, & Kirkpatrick, 2015). Recognizing heterogeneity may be important to building understanding of suburban landscape patterns, including the location and extent of wooded areas for carbon storage. For example, in our study, respondents who preferred the entire yard to be more wooded stand out as having distinct preferred yard characteristics: they liked large trees and privacy, wanted a yard that was good for wildlife and good for the environment, did not prefer having flowers in the front yard or a garden in the backyard, and were less concerned about neatness in the backyard. Tactics to store more carbon in their yards might promote the habitat value of more extensive areas of dense trees with a shrubby understory in the yard. In contrast, respondents who preferred a more turf-dominated, less wooded yard liked flowers and neatness in the entire yard, did not want shade in the backyard, and were less concerned about having a yard that was good for wildlife or good for the environment. Tactics to store more carbon in their yards might include mature canopy trees that are not too dense to screen the view beyond, and a low even ground plane including garden plantings, as shown in our survey. Older trees store more carbon than young trees, and design and planning should protect older trees in the development process as well as from unwise homeowner decisions.",Y,"Conservation, Management",Conservation,Management,N/A,"Differences between the front and backyard have implications for carbon storage. Front yards are used less frequently and for fewer activities, but designs to enhance carbon storage in the backyard must accommodate a greater number and range of activities. Homeowners widely prefer a private backyard that is “good for wildlife” and can be used for socializing and play. Planting and retention of trees and shrubs could help to achieve these characteristics. At the same time, some homeowners’ desire for flower or food gardens may limit their acceptance of trees that shade the yard. For these homeowners, designs that incorporate more trees should allow for some of the backyard to get adequate sunlight for gardening. Design and planning tactics to enhance carbon storage in suburban yards must take into account neighborhood norms and legacy effects of past developer and homeowner choices. Retaining existing trees and planting more trees to increase carbon storage as part of residential landscapes can be achieved with greater knowledge of homeowner’s preferences and behaviors. This suggests that local governments should engage early in the development process to promote subdivision patterns to include more extensive wooded areas. If design and policy align with homeowner preferences, yard activities, and cultural norms to achieve enhanced carbon storage, landscape designs that include more wooded areas will be more likely to last and provide ecological benefits into the future.",,KHT

While this percentage looks small, it is important to put it in the context of the other conventional mitigation efforts that cities take. The overall conclusion of our paper is that biogenic emissions and sequestration are important levers for carbon mitigation.

Multi-layered plantings, in which herb, shrub, and tree layers overlap, would increase C storage and uptake per unit area, and maintain a multi-aged tree structure to promote continuous C uptake over time. Third, ordinances should be amended to increase greenspace area in urban lands. Based on current landscape-related ordinances in Korea (Kwon et al., 1996), no plantings are required within a residential lot smaller than 200 m2, and urban parks should be 1500 m2 or larger. Fourth, tree species that have high growth rates, even under adverse urban growing conditions, should be planted. Broad-leaved tree species have higher growth rates than conifers and shrubs.

During the process of urbanization in the study area, new green infrastructures keep up with the urban development.

The lowest average CO2 storage and sequestration per tree was in cycle paths (Table 1). Overall, differences in the average CO2 storage and sequestration by streetscape type depended on species composition, DBH size, growth, and presence of monumental trees.

For example, they can be used to complement or integrated into carbon offset accounting protocols (CalFIRE and USFS, 2014) or national urban forest carbon stock assessments (Nowak et al., 2013). Also, according to the Italian Law on urban green spaces (LEGGE, 2013), Italian municipalities have to plant a new tree for every resident child born or adopted in the municipality. Therefore, tree plantings can partially offset the annual CO2 emissions of every child born. For example, information from the Registry of the Municipality of Bolzano indicates 972 births (+1.6% increment) in 2012, that equates to 972 new tree plantings. Thus, new tree plantings in parks would result in an additional carbon sequestration of 52.42 Mg/year with a CO2 offset of 0.09%.

Moreover, we propose to plant bigger tree-trunk diameters of 2 cm for shrubs, 4 cm for trees (Table 1) to have a higher ES level from the beginning of the project.","Above-ground biomass, Below-ground biomass","Carbon storage defines the quantity of carbon accumulated in the above-ground and below-ground parts of woody vegetation. Equations from literature and available tree data show that compared to traditional forest trees, open-grown trees—as the urban and peri-urban ones—tend to have less biomass [49]. In order to consider that difference, biomass results were multiplied by 0.8. The calculation of the tree dry-weight biomass was the stored carbon by multiplying by 0.5. Carbon sequestration is instead defined as the removal of carbon dioxide from the air by plants. To calculate the amount of carbon sequestered annually, I-Tree Eco considers average diameter growth from the proper genera, diameter class and tree condition. These data are added to the existing tree diameter, incrementing tree size step by step each year.",N/A,N/A,Y,Patch,"The amount of carbon annually sequestered can increase as far as the tree’s dimension and health increase. In the first case, I-Tree estimates the gross sequestration equal to 1212 metric tons of carbon per year, while in the second one, the estimation is equal to 5.59 tons per year. Regarding carbon storage, the first scenario stored 1.16 metric tons of carbon. Of the species sampled, Acer campestre stores the most carbon (approximately 10.6% of the total carbon stored), and Sambucus nigra sequesters the most (approximately 10.5% of all sequestered carbon). The second one can store 7.8 ton. of carbon, mainly thanks to a more significant dimension of the trees and related bigger trunk diameter. The comparison of the two scenarios underlines an interesting difference in the ES provision and the vegetation structure. Each scenario shows our pros and cons that must carefully be evaluated as a requalification choice. An essential key in the ES provision is species-selection. The most successful species related to C sequestration, C storage and avoided run-off within our database is Sambucus nigra. Our results confirmed several studies that showed the potential role of Sambucus nigra in accumulating pollution, from the soil and the air.",N,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Don't make clear recommendations ,DMR

The total area is 48.85 km2, covering seven wards with a total population of 451,462 [28]. Field sampling of 1230 street trees was conducted from June to October 2018. Approximately 10% of street trees on the 41 streets were sampled at equal distances to generate the tree inventory (Figure 1).

To maximize the trees’ potential for reducing energy consumption and ensure longterm net benefits from continuous levels of tree canopy cover, heavy pruning should be discontinued, and planting strips should be advocated in new street tree plans.

The field survey was conducted in September and October, 2006. For the 213 accessible sample plot, forest type was recorded. Within each plot, we recorded the species name, diameter at breast height (DBH), and health condition for each tree. Six types of health condition were included, based on the proportion of dead branches in the crown of a tree.","Above-ground biomass, Below-ground biomass","The biomass of an individual tree is typically calculated based on either the DBH alone, or a combination of the DBH and tree height (H). In this study, we used DBH only as this type of biomass equations does not require the measure of tree height, and thus can reduce uncertainty. In cases only equations that were used to calculate above-ground biomass were available, the whole tree biomass was estimated based on the root-to-shoot ratio of 0.25. Therefore, we gave a 20% biomass reduction only for trees with DBH greater than 30 cm (Nowak, 1994). The dry biomass was then converted to C by multiplying 0.5 (Nowak, 1994; Nowak and Crane, 2002). After that, C density (t/ha) was calculated for each plot. Carbon sequestration was estimated as the difference of C stored between year y and year y + 1, based on the annual growth rates of tree DBH. For deciduous species, C stored by foliage was subtracted, while for evergreen species, there was a 25% of foliage C reduction by assuming 3-year leaf retention. ",2006,2006,N,Individual,"Carbon stored by urban forests was 337,000 t, among which EF and AF accounted for 41% and 34%, respectively. The averaged C density was 33.22 t/ha. Attached Forest had the highest C density (50.17 t/ha), followed by RF, LF, EF, and PF. The annual C sequestration by urban forests was 28,820 t. Similar to carbon storage, the majority of the C was sequestered by EF and AF (40% and 38%, respectively). The C sequestration rate was 2.84 t/ha/yr. For different types of urban forests, the C sequestration rate ranged from 1.16 t/ha/yr for PF to 4.78 t/ha/yr for AF (Table 6). Firstly, Shenyang had fewer big trees than cities such as Sacramento and Beijing. The ages of the trees, or the size of the trees (DBH) affect C storage and sequestration (Nowak, 1994). Generally, large healthy trees store and sequester more C than small health trees (Nowak, 1994). Therefore, Shenyang had a lower C density than these cities. Secondly, urban forests in Shenyang were dominated by fast-growth species (Table 5). This fast-growth species has relatively high rates of C sequestration, in turn leading to a higher C sequestration rate. In addition, the higher C sequestration rate of urban forests in Shenyang may be partly due to the relatively high tree density (Table 7).",Y,Management,Management,N/A,N/A,"This has some important management implications. Firstly, there are still great potentials to increase the total area of urban forests in Shenyang. Currently, the urban forest cover is only 22.28%. The climatic and physiographic condition of Shenyang is very suitable for tree growth. More trees can be planted and more C can be stored and sequestered. In particular, planting trees of native species with fast growth rates may further improve the capacity of C storage and sequestration of urban forests. Our results indicated that the majority of the urban trees were in their early stage, suggesting an increasing C storage density and sequestration rate with the growth of those trees (Nowak, 1994; Yang et al., 2005). However, these young trees in urban areas require careful management and maintenance. In addition, many of the patches of urban forests have a single layer of tree species, with similar ages. Therefore, there are great potentials to enhance the capacity of these urban forests in C storage and sequestration by optimizing their structure, such as the creation of multiple layers of trees, shrubs and grass, and a mixture of trees with different ages.",,DMR

For example, species in the genus Fraxinus accounted for 19.4% of the total carbon stored in our tree population. Given concerns over the EAB (Poland and McCullough, 2006; City of Bloomington, 2012), it is expected that widespread die-off or removal of Fraxinus trees will result in substantial losses of stored carbon from Bloomington’s residential urban forest, as well as shifts in the age distribution of the tree population. Thus, our research demonstrates there are bigger tree-species “winners” in terms of basal area and the provision of carbon storage services than there are by relative abundance.

Diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.37 m) was measured with calipers, and height was measured with a Blume-Leiss BL6 hypsometer from a distance of 30 m. Diameter at 1 m was also measured as this was the height at which diameter was measured for the municipal tree inventory.

The current study featured more species, however, and the full list of allometric equations can be found in Appendix A. The dry weight above-ground biomass is multiplied by 0.5 to obtain carbon storage (Nowak and Crane, 2002).

The lowest sequestration was observed on the wasteland (unoccupied), the highly maintained hospital and commercial grounds, and in the city centre and vineyards (the vines are not included in the carbon estimates). The overall average carbon storage for Meran is 13.5 t/ha. Taking the 24.7 % tree cover estimate for Meran from Speak et al. (2018) the carbon storage per area tree cover is 5.47 kg C/m2. Differences between end-of-life wood management techniques were revealed, with burning with energy recovery for electricity being the most efficient with a carbon emissions/input ratio of 0.5. Landfill was the least efficient with a ratio of 121.9. The fate of this end-of-life wood has significant implications for carbon budget calculations in cities worldwide. Consequentially, the generally low figures for sequestration potential for city trees indicate that tree planting is perhaps not the optimum method for attaining carbon neutrality of a city. In fact in some situations, urban vegetation may act as a net source of emissions (Velasco et al., 2016).",N,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,DMR

Enhancing the connectivity of green spaces within the green belt could also connect neighborhoods of different socioeconomic levels, improve social mixing, and provide equitable access to UES among different social categories. New urban projects in proposed development areas should address the gentrification risk to ensure equal opportunities to a healthy environment among various socioeconomic classes. Urban policies could go beyond distributional justice to procedural justice to involve different social classes in making connections among neighborhoods. Spatial results of areas with high or low UES delivery could be crossed with the zoning of the local urbanism plan (PLU) to better inform on the risk of environmental degradation if future development occurs. For instance, few high UES provision patches were located within areas assigned to future urbanization. In this case, strategies to maintain UES provision in these areas could be investigated (Baro ́ et al. 2016).

Therefore preserving large trees and protecting existing forests during urbanization might be more effective at offsetting CO2 than massive tree plantings. Increasing the amount of layers using shrubs and smaller trees is also an important way to improve carbon sequestration and provide secondary ecosystem services such as mitigation of wind storm damage (Duryea et al., 2007; Escobedo et al., 2009a). In the case on Miami-Dade County, over 30 percent of the actual net C sequestration is in stands of M. quinquinervia,an undesirable, highly invasive, exotic tree.

",Y,Management,Management,N/A,N/A,"To promote sustainable urban development, more intensive utilization of built-up lands should be implemented. The rainfall in reservoirs [in urban core counties] should be captured and stored to provide relief in times of drought. First, this region should continue to implement existing water-saving and wastewater treatment plans and policies including the “Water Supply and Water Conservation Management Plan”,the“Consent Decree Project”,the“Wastewater Management Plan”, and some specific wastewater management strategies, including decommissioning of less efficient facilities, discharging high-quality effluent into Lake Lanier and so on (http:// northgeorgiawater.org/). Second, other water-saving and wastewater treatment engineering measures and technologies can be adopted in different sectors, such as (1) pretreating and recycling gray water (Stec et al., 2017); (2) improving agricultural irrigation infrastructure and reducing seepage losses (Devkota et al., 2015); (3) promoting more rational allocation of water for different crops (Mostafa and Fujimoto, 2014); (4) collecting rainwater and exploiting it for multiple purpose (Campisano et al., 2017); (5) adopting water replacement and secondary recycling technologies (Gu et al., 2016); (6) selecting advanced wastewater treatment technologies (Talvitie et al., 2017); and (7) purifying wastewater through artificial wetlands (Lu et al., 2015). Third, setting riparian vegetation buffer zones is a feasible ecological engineering measure, and the RVB scenario in this study revealed that doing so can enhance water purification effectively. For this region [the urban expansion area], our study showed that optimizing land use strategies, such as the compact use of built-up land and reforestation under the MCG and RVB scenarios, can be helpful for enhancing carbon storage, habitat quality, and recreational opportunity. For carbon storage, the “City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan,” put forward in 2015 should continue to be implemented (CAMOS (City of Atlanta Mayor's Office of Sustainability), 2016). Forest resource management should be enhanced, such as choosing the tree species which have a greater capacity to fix carbon, increasing the proportion of mature trees and so on (Hernández et al., 2017). Optimizing agricultural management through efficient use of fertilizers, irrigation, and tillage can enhance carbon storage. Establishing nature reserves would play a central role in biodiversity protection. Future planning should include measures that reduce the separating effects of road infrastructure and maintain landscape connectivity. A wide variety of recreational facilities that offer increased recreational opportunities for residents should be built, such as fishing, bird watching and boating. The natural and semi-natural ecosystems, especially nature reserves in these [surrounding suburban] counties, should continue to be protected in future land use planning. Both afforestation in the riparian zones and on the steep slopes can increase infiltration and reduce runoff, effectively reducing soil erosion. Some techniques also can be implemented to reduce soil losses, including (1) crop and vegetation management measures such as cover crops, grass or leaf litter mulching, and strip cropping (Didoné et al., 2017); (2) soil management measures such as no-tillage, reduced tillage, drainage and soil amendment; and (3) mechanical conservation measures such as terracing, contour farming and geotextiles. However, the negative effects of these measures on other ESs cannot be neglected. It is crucial to enhance the sustainability of food production in these counties. Agricultural tactics such as applying organic soil remedies, using innovative irrigation devices, and cultivating new crop varieties should be promoted.",,EC

Although smaller-stature yard trees stored the least CO2, they provided substantial energy savings and avoided emissions per tree planted (1.26 t). These benefits can be increased by strategically locating yard trees to shade the west walls of air conditioned buildings. There is more potential to plant largestature trees along streets than in yards. The CO2 storage potential of street trees can be actualized through planting such trees where space permits. This strategy will promote energy savings as well, except when evergreen street trees are planted south of buildings and winter irradiance is attenuated.",,DMR

""However, whilst the associations remain positive, their strength differs depending on whether they have been mapped at 500 m grid squares, the OA or the HECA spatial units. For 500 m grid squares, there are strong associations (rhoZ0.33) between heat island mitigation, reduction of stormwater runoff, carbon storage, cultural ecosystem services and habitat provision.""
""There was a tendency for certain services to occur together in hotspots (Table 5). Heat island mitigation, carbon storage and cultural opportunities co-occurred with each other as hotpots in 8–11% of polygons in the 500 m grid square unit at the 10% threshold.""
""We obtained consistently different results by using three distinct spatial units of analysis. The different spatial units represent fundamentally different aspects of the system, and the fact that the choice of units has profoundly affected the conclusions drawn means that it is critical to choose a method of delineating spatial areas that is appropriate to the question or management decision of interest. For example, should a decision require an understanding of how altering urban form may influence ecosystem service production, boundaries similar to the HECA would be ideal as they delineate areas of relatively homogeneous land use, and by extension urban morphology.""",N,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,KHT

""The net carbon sequestration of Torbay’s trees was estimated at 3,320tC yr21 (based upon gross carbon sequestration of 4,279tC yr21 minus calculated emissions of 959tC yr21 due to tree death). Carbon sequestered is likely to be released in the long-term when trees decompose or are burnt (sometimes as a fossil fuel substitute), but can be stored for medium-term as wood. Multiplication for the non-traded price leads to the results below, a fairly significant welfare benefit.""
""Figure 1 shows the annual carbon sequestration results for the lifespan of the trees. The cherry has the lowest lifespan and sequestration, followed by pine, lime and oak. It’s clear that repeated planting of the trees with shorter lifespans would not achieve the same sequestration over the period as the longer-lived trees. Maximum benefits are achieved by allowing the larger trees to grow to maturity.""
""Staff costs dominate the cost-side, and that the maintenance and planting of highway (street trees) is more costly than park trees. Total quantified costs are £0.42 million. The only significant public cost which is unlikely to be captured is the additional cost of cleaning up leaf litter. There will also be some private costs not captured, such as a neighbour’s trees providing unwanted shade.""
""The results show that the proportion of urban tree costs which can be justified through carbon sequestration and air pollution removal benefits varies dramatically from tree to tree. For oak trees planted in parks about one fifth of the cost can be justified this way, whereas for cherry trees planted on the street it’s only one hundredth. The variation is driven partly by the qualities of the trees, with the larger longer-lived trees providing greater benefits. It is also partly driven by location, with street trees requiring greater levels of investment.""
",Y,Management,Management,N/A,N/A,"""Nevertheless, the results show that whilst at the standard UK discount rate urban tree planting cannot be financially justified by the carbon sequestration and air-quality benefits alone, these benefits make a significant contribution to the justification for planting some trees in an urban context, particularly larger, longer-lived trees. The native oak performs particularly well. This partial costbenefit analysis should not by itself be used to decide whether or not to plant trees in urban environments, but does draw attention to some benefits which are not often considered.""",,KHT

""The C sequestration of street trees per unit area in Beijing is comparable in order of magnitude to that of non-urban forests.
