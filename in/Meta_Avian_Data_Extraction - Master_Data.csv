In upland forests, stopover abundance was 86% higher for Neotropical transients and 118% higher for temperate transients than in riparian forests. These overall differences were driven by strong patterns of occurrence for individual species, with 20 of 27 species occurring significantly more frequently in mature upland forests where these species do not remain to breed (unpubl. data). The magnitudes of these differences were surprising with 16 of 20 species being at least twice as abundant within upland sites. Indeed, species such as Blue-headed Vireo, Palm Warbler (Dendroica palmarum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) were 4.6 to 12.9 times more abundant in upland forests. Two exceptions to this pattern were Northern Parula and Baltimore Oriole.

As a result, it seems likely that the majority of individuals recorded in riparian forests were transients, suggesting that these two species exhibited some en route selectivity for riparian forests.Structural differences between habitats may influence the stopover decisions of migrants. In our study, abundance of temperate transients was positively associated with sites that had greater horizontal heterogeneity (i.e., lower percent canopy cover) and were more vertically stratified (denser shrub layer).

Where bridges are inevitable, their barrier effect can be mitigated by flanking them with tall trees to reduce gap width and to provide safe passage for birds above moving traffic (see Tremblay & St.Clair 2009 for specifics).A second approach, which targets urban-adaptable species like chickadees, consists of enhancing the permeability of the urban matrix itself through the incorporation of elements designed to minimize gaps in vegetation. For example, even sparsely distributed trees can facilitate bird movements through heavily developed areas. Particular attention should be paid to major transportation corridors because they create continuous gaps in forest cover that cannot be circumvented by moving birds. The barrier effect of such features can be at least partially mitigated through the strategic planting of trees along roadsides and on central reservations (medians) with an aim to reduce gap width (see Tremblay & St. Clair 2009). Similarly, the barrier effect of multiple gaps can potentially be reduced by the provision of treed areas between adjacent gaps,which can act as stepping stones.In all roadside plantings, tall trees should be favoured over shrubby vegetation to minimize the risk of collisions with vehicles. Finally, ‘green bridges’ (i.e.structures featuring vegetative cover) may facilitate movement across major transportation corridors",,RK

Dead trees made up 10 % of forests, while dead trees were absent in parks and made up only 1 % of the trees in residential areas. While it may appear that possible habitat exists for some excavator species, the specific attributes necessary for woodpeckers may be mostly absent in most urban areas. Management of forest areas for cavity excavators promotes retaining a diverse stand structure in terms of tree sizes and decay classes (Fan et al. 2003). The preservation of forest habitat is essential for the integrity of excavated cavities and the species that rely on them.

nested rather than a random distributional pattern. Fragment size had an important influence on nestedness at the community and individual species levels. Nearly 55% of the species, on average, tended to occupy larger than smaller fragments. Habitat diversity affected community composition patterns as well. Species accumulated in fragments with increasing diversity of stems. That was particularly the case with many insectivorous birds (Parus sp., Troglodytes troglodytes, Aegithalos caudatus and Phylloscopus bonelli), which relied upon forest substrates to cope with their food requirements.Besides the classic area and habitat diversity effects, human disturbance can also promote nestedness: locally, by restraining the time and space of foraging and breeding opportunities, thus reducing fragment suitability, and regionally, by increasing extinction and decreasing colonization probabilities in highly disturbed fragments.",Yes,Conservation,Conservation,,,"First, the increase in local levels of human disturbance can affect community structure at the landscape scale, decreasing the suitability and availability of fragments for reproduction. This must be evaluated in areas with increasing levels of ecotourists due to the popularity of wildlife recreational activities, such as national parks, natural reserves, etc. Second, human disturbance could increase the convergence of communities to nested subsets (Patterson and Atmar 1986), leading to areas dominated by widespread species with high tolerance to people. If so, rare or low-tolerant species could be restraining their breeding to low-disturbed and large fragments only. Third, area may be interacting with human disturbance in such a way as to become a sort of buffer against which pedestrian effects may be reduced (Fox and Fox 2000). Since small fragments have higher edge/area ratios than large fragments, similar visitation levels would further decrease the proportion of suitable area on small fragments. If human visitation were to be increased temporarily, then large fragments would be the appropriate target spots due to this buffering effect. ",,RK

Mow less, make paved trails narrower, leave certain trails within the system unpaved, and locate trails at the greenway edge to maximize forest interior. If vegetation removal is necessary for sight lines on steep terrain, leave forest litter rather than planting grass or ornamentals. Recommendations for specific maximum trail widths are difficult to formulate because of regional variations in bird communities and environmental factors. Instead, we suggest that trails and the associated managed areas be narrow enough that the forest canopy remains relatively unbroken. 
2. Conserve wider greenways. Greenways of at least 100 m wide provide habitat for some development-sensitive species, but greenways as wide as 300–600 m may be needed to conserve certain forest-interior specialists and ground-nesting songbirds. When greenways of this width are not realistic, larger non-linear reserves are needed to provide habitat for these species. These might be located as “nodes” along greenways.
3. Encourage developers of property adjacent to greenways to
minimize pavement, building, and bare earth cover. Through

Snag density was positively correlated with density of live trees. Snags in built versus forested portions were similar in all attributes except decay, which was more advanced in forested areas. In the oldest suburbs (60–80 years old), snags in forested portions were larger, more decayed, and more likely to have broken tops than those in younger suburbs (2–20 years old). Cavity-nesting bird species richness and equity of individuals per species was highest in suburban landscapes where remaining forest was not fragmented, but adjacent to highly intermixed urban and urban-forest land covers.

Fortunately, retaining forest and interspersing forest and built areas are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Sites with high interspersion of forest and urban areas require at least moderate amounts of forest: one site had 27% forest and contained all nine species of birds. This site was 30-years old, which suggests that this amount of forest can maintain cavity-nesting bird populations following development.

Variety in development pattern may become increasingly important as large areas of forest are developed. To increase densities and reproductive success of all species, different patterns of developments with differing amounts of percent forest would be prudent. For example, planners in the Pacific Northwest should design some developments that retain at least 60% forest for every 100 ha developed, where mean forest patch sizes are 20–30 ha, and some that have 27% to 60% forest in a variety of patch sizes interspersed with urban areas. Forested parks (70%–96% forest; large mean forest patch sizes 23–30 ha; very small mean urban patch sizes 0.14 to 0.74 ha) would complement these urban areas for the benefit of cavity-nesting birds. When deciding which forest areas to conserve, we recommend targeting conservation efforts to areas with high densities of existing snags (>8 snags ≥25 cm DBH ha−1), and live trees (>318 trees ha−1). These management suggestions would also provide the diversity of forest conditions used by mature and early-successional forest songbirds (Donnelly 2002, Donnelly and Marzluff 2004).

Active management may be needed within built portions of suburban landscapes to conserve snags with characteristics important to cavity-nesters. Based on snags used by cavity-nesting birds in our study, efforts should be made to conserve all snags that are large in diameter (minimum of 30–40 cm), more decayed (class 2), red alder and coniferous species, taller (>18 m), with broken tops, with some bark remaining, with conk fungus, and containing other cavities.

well-vegetated suburbs or forests. Species richness tended to peak in eucalypt forest remnants of
area 10-20 ha. In contrast, the various land cover types showed much stronger differences in both their species
composition and the occurrence of species within particular functional groups. Treed suburbs supported many native
species. Also, the occurrence of these birds was not clearly related to whether or not the suburban
vegetation mainly consisted of native plants.",Yes,Management,Management,,,"Within the suburban matrix, habitat structure and resource availability must be important
determinants of which species use different forms of suburban development. There is some
indication that patch size of suburban land cover types also plays a role. When surveys were
conducted within areas where there was 20 ha or more of relatively uniform land cover (either bare
or treed suburb) there were clear differences in the avifauna (Figures 1 and 2, Table 2). However,
when sites within the suburban habitat were selected on the basis of habitat immediately around the
0.3 ha transect, there were negligible avifaunal differences between bare and treed areas (Catterall
et al., 1991; discussed by Sewell and Catterall, 1998).
For remnant patches of eucalypt forest, the smallest size category (1-2 ha) had a very similar
avifauna to that of the treed suburbs, whereas the largest size (10-20 ha) had a very similar
avifauna to the large eucalypt forest tracts (Figures 1 and 2, Table 2). Remnants 4-10 ha in size
were transitional. Thus, there appears to be a threshold size for eucalypt forest remnants of around
5-10 ha, at which their bird assemblages become very similar, especially in functional terms, to
areas of intact forest (Figure 3; see also Martin and Catterall, 2001; Piper and Catterall, 2003).
Furthermore, there is a spatial scaling transition at around 1-2 ha, where the role of a very small
forest patch in providing habitat for avifauna is very similar to the role of a liberal supply of
scattered individual trees or shrubs, without the consolidated structure of intact forest.
In practical terms, this means that the retention or creation of very small (<2 ha) patches of
eucalypt forest habitat are both likely to have similar biodiversity outcomes to planting or retaining
individual elements (trees and shrubs) within urban developments, gardens or landscaping projects.
And it also means that these biodiversity outcomes are different from those which would follow the
retention or creation of larger forest patches. The latter will provide habitat for a forest avifauna of
neglected foliphiles, whereas the former results in a distinctive, non-transitional assemblage of
large-bodied, native species, dominated by the aussi icons. ",,RK

The fact that the horizontal coverage rather than the vertical coverage of vegetation affected the bird community explains the significance of the horizontal shielding function of vegetation, which facilitates the survival of birds in areas with high levels of human disturbance. In addition, water bodies had significant positive effects on all three bird community indices, thereby suggesting that the benefits of wetlands in urban green spaces for bird conservation require further study.""",Yes,Management,Management,,,"""(1) Vegetation species composition: a diversified woody plant composition supports a greater diversity of bird communities. For example, planting coniferous trees has always been recommended to maximize the bird species richness (Fontana et al., 2011). Coniferous trees were the most abundant tree species in BFP. The fruiting seasons of these tree species were from November to January when most of the feeding behaviors were observed, i.e., pecking coniferous tree seeds. Moreover, Chace and Walsh (2006) suggested that native vegetation should be beneficial for retaining the native bird community. The woody plant communities of the parks in Shanghai City have been designed largely for human recreational needs. Therefore, different ways of improving the composition of woody plant species to enhance bird communities is an important area for future research. (2) Habitat structure: woodland with a well-developed understory was the best habitat for urban birds, according to the analysis of the bird species richness. However, some birds had specific habitat requirements, e.g., Motacilla flava and M. cinerea were observed only in open short vegetated areas, while nine water bird species were only present near water bodies in BFP (Table S2). Therefore, enhancing the overall urban bird diversity requires various types of habitats in urban green spaces. (3) Horizontal coverage: in areas with high levels of human disturbance, the horizontal shielding function of shrub cover is an important habitat component that affects the observation of human activities and bird survival. Heyman (2010) confirmed that 50% removal of shrubs did not affect the local bird diversity, which is useful information for the design of management plans in urban green spaces. However, BFP is a park with a moderate density of visitors per year for Shanghai City. The shielding function of shrubs for bird survival should be evaluated in urban parks with much higher densities of visitors. Moreover, the bird communities in urban green spaces could be affected greatly by the extent of urbanization (Clergeau et al., 2006) and different bird species should have distinctive functional landscape heterogeneity levels in the same urban landscape context (Fahrig et al., 2011). Consequently, to test the outcomes of this research, we recommend that further studies examine the relationships between the bird community and urban green vegetation in Shanghai City in more parks with different densities of visitors, which should also consider the urban landscape contexts of these parks.""",Strong and specific recommendations!!!,KHT

species to certain structural attributes of greenspaces, such
as the presence of mature and heterogeneous forest stands
(high level of DBH). Among the analyzed greenspaces, Parco Nord (Milan) provided the most encouraging results in terms of species richness. Such results could be explained
by: the large extension covered by this greenspace (approximately 600 ha), the high percentage of mature forest trees, and the relevant distance to city center. Besides these characteristics, it is important to consider the spatial connectivity of greenspaces with the surrounding landscape components, especially forest patches, open spaces, grasslands and mixed-croplands with presence of hedgerows (Sodhi et al. 1999; Farina 2006). For example, Giardino di via Pallavicino, Parco Solari and Giardino di via Ravizza in Milan although having approximately the same extension (16 ha) revealed a contrasting patterns in terms of species richness.  This could be explained by the fact that Giardino di via Pallavicino and Parco Solari belong to a system of parks and other greenspaces (public and private lands) which constitutes a kind of ecological network supporting bird species dispersal. In the case of the “great tit,” DBHmax was the only interval providing
significant results. The resulting regression curve for the “great tit” revealed a positive correlation between DBH and species abundance: the higher the tree diameter the higher the abundance
of the species. This could be explained by the habitat preference of the great tit for large trees (Cowie and Hinsley 1988). T",Yes,Management,Management,,,"1) The dimension of greenspaces and the amount of tree cover are critical factors supporting avian ecological diversity in urban environments. As a consequence, urban forest planners and managers should promote the planning and design of large greenspaces within cities and the connection
of greenspaces with the surrounding landscape elements.
2) The structural heterogeneity of forest trees within greenspaces (explained by the DBH analysis) is a fundamental aspect supporting high level of species abundance of birds.
3) The conservation of species diversity in urban areas should be based on the knowledge on one or more indicators species having different habitat requirements in terms of vegetation
and trees’ structure (as explained by Ficetola et al. 2007).

Increase greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. These greenspaces can range in size and management intensity from pedestrian parkland to laneways, informal-use sporting fields, managed town parks, road verges or squares. Over small scales (i.e. \0.2 km2), connectivity and configuration are less important than accumulative greenspace area. Moreover, not only will increasing greenspace cover improve bird diversity values within individual greenspace patches, but recent research demonstrates that greenspaces also provide substantial values to the humans that use them. For example, Luck et al. (2011) found that the proportion of neighbourhood vegetation cover was positively correlated with the personal wellbeing of residents in 36 Australian neighbourhoods.
2. Increase vegetation structure in greenspaces. Parks with high numbers of large (DBH C 50 cm) eucalypts supported more individual birds and more woodland and hollow-nesting species. Recent findings show that as the size of these eucalypts increase, their positive effect on bird diversity also increases (Stagoll et al. 2012). Furthermore, several studies demonstrate that maintaining and improving vegetation structure within urban parks can achieve tangible biodiversity outcomes (Shwartz et al. 2008; Fontana et al. 2011).

While numerous factors may contribute to a lack of street-tree density, our results, and those of others, suggest this will likely occur in lower-income communities (Landry and Chakraborty 2009, Schroeter 2017). (2) Incentivize maintenance: once cities identify zones that are lacking in street-tree density, promoting, planting, and maintaining street trees should be a goal. Many municipalities are already well-aware of #1 and working to address #2 (e.g., Pincetl 2010). However, this is a difficult task since many units in lower-income communities are often not owner-occupied. Thus, there may be less of an incentive to encourage the growth of a street tree in front of the property (Landry and Chakraborty 2009). In these cases, cities should work to incentivize street-tree care to the property owners or renters or provide public resources to promote the longevity of planted street trees. (3) Street-tree density targets: If cities plant and maintain trees, our results suggest a target of approximately 40–120 street trees/1 km of street will likely attract feeding birds. We note that, in our system, there were few residential study areas with <40 trees/ 1 km. Thus, our confidence in estimates at these ranges is low. The 40–120 numbers refer to trees on both sides of a street and can likely be halved if only considering one side of a street. Some municipalities may have zones where this is not feasible. If so, our study suggests that even modest increases in streettree density – coupled with careful consideration of tree species - will likely provide valuable habitat to feeding birds. (4) Long-term maintenance: long-term maintenance of street trees and the encouragement of their growth is imperative to maximize the benefit to urban avifauna. Our results suggest that targeting up to approximately 125 m2 of the area covered by street trees per 1 km will likely attract feeding birds. (5) Inventory: many municipalities have inventories in place detailing information such as the location, size, date planted, health, and species of tree, for all street trees within city boundaries. Having a detailed street-tree inventory is a critical step for municipalities to understand how to manage street trees based on a city’s needs, including providing assessments (the current study) and services to aid biodiversity (Dudek 2018). Further, detailed inventories allow for appropriate planning of diversity targets for street trees (Santamour 1990, McPherson et al. 2016). (6) Native and nonnative trees: our study indicates that the common native trees of our region, along with a handful of nonnative street trees can be beneficial to feeding birds. We do stress that the vast majority of nonnative trees in LA appear to provide little apparent benefit to the feeding birds of our study. Thus, our work suggests that careful consideration is required to determine the best street trees to plant and maintain if providing habitat for birds is a goal. If possible, municipalities should use available information (e.g., National Audubon Society 2019) coupled with careful study to identify which trees will provide essential services to both humans and birds. (7) Value of studying feeding birds: while there are numerous taxa of wildlife found in cities that likely utilize street trees (e.g., insects, birds, mammals), we suggest focusing attention on feeding birds. Birds are one of the most abundant and diverse wildlife taxa in most cities throughout the world (Lepczyk et al. 2017b). Further, they are relatively easy to study compared with other abundant taxa (e.g., insects; Bhullar and Majer 2000). A bird feeding on a tree substrate is an intricate and detailed ecological process that yields great information about which trees are beneficial to birds, and possibly other wildlife (Holmes and Robinson 1981, Gabbe et al. 2002, Wood et al. 2012).

We found that the proximity and availability of cover influenced a bird's perception of risk. Birds ate more food (perceived less risk) when they were closer to the nearest cover, had more overhead canopy coverage and were closer to the contiguous natural area. We found no evidence that high canopy cover increased perceived predation risk as in Carrascal and Alonso (2006), however, the semi-natural conditions in this urban setting did not present many inner forest like conditions. The amount of food eaten varied by fragmentation type reflecting a trade-off between the proximity of cover and the canopy coverage that the surrounding vegetation provides. As canopy coverage largely depends on leaf cover, this trade-off is likely seasonal (foliated vs. defoliated) and varies whether the predominant vegetation type is coniferous or deciduous (Jokimaki and Suhonen 1998).we show that the interaction between the distance to a natural source area and the type of fragmentation is important to bird forage use. ",Yes,Conservation,Conservation,,,"In increasingly fragmented urban areas, planners’ ability to maintain connectivity among suitable habitat patches and provide refuges for individuals looking to avoid locally risky situations is crucial for conservation efforts (Jokimaki and Suhonen 1998; St. Clair et al. 1998; Marzluff and Ewing 2001; Tremblay and St. Clair 2009, 2011). In particular, care must be taken to avoid crossing critical connectivity thresholds that result in the isolation of larger patches, or the avoidance of smaller patches (With and Crist 1995). Isolation is problematic because resident foragers may not have access to foraging opportunities with low risk. As a result, residents may suffer increased predation rates or increased non-consumptive predation effects, potentially resulting in extirpation of individuals from the isolated patch (Lima and Dill 1990; Preisser and Blonick 2008). Our results suggest that planting trees or shrubs in large open areas may be enough to encourage bird use (Tremblay and St. Clair 2009, 2011; de Castro Pena et al. 2017).",,RK

These fragments were dominated by trees in the genera Eucalyptus, Acacia and Leptospermum and shrubs in the genera Grevillea and Banksia. The area and degree of isolation of each park were calculated with a Geographical Information System from digital images held by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment. For isolation, we used the Treeden25 program in which three densities of tree cover are derived from SPOT panchromatic imagery by digital classification and visual interpretation. Isolation (ISOL1) was determined from the percentage of dense vegetation cover within 1 km of the park boundary, so that a relatively isolated park had a low percentage score.

eucalypt forest, was measured from scale maps.",Many,More than 10,More than 10,Y,"Pre-urbanization, the study area was predominantly hard-leaved forest dominated by eucalypts; the particular forested parks that we studied mostly comprised remnant vegetation communities that were a variant of this habitat type (Gray and Knight, 2001).",2003,2003,May,August,Y,Y,Community,Demographics/Patterns,Demographics/Patterns,,,,Species distribution,Species distribution,"Native birds comprised 87% of sightings, but two exotic species were common. Bird species’ distribution among the parks was significantly nested. However, park rank orders for bird assemblage nestedness and mean pedestrian traffic rate were not correlated and only one species’ distribution was nested with respect to this variable. The observed correlation between park area and bird assemblage nestedness may have been partly due to passive sampling. Degree of isolation of parks influenced nestedness less than park area. Forested parks provided habitat for species that occur at intermediate to low densities in other suburban habitats and for ecological specialists otherwise rare in suburbia. Larger parks contained more species than, and many of the native species found in, smaller parks. However, smaller parks each had 25% of the native bird species inhabiting the suite of fragments and thus had both aesthetic value and some potential to enhance city-dwellers’ awareness about biodiversity conservation.",Yes,Management,Management,,,"Our data are also relevant to the debate about conservation reserve size (Single-Largeor-Several-Small or SLOSS) (Simberloff and Abele, 1982). We showed that park area was
strongly correlated with both bird assemblage nestedness and species richness. Thus the smaller forest fragments had less native bird conservation potential because (a) they were
relatively species-poor and (b) their bird species assemblages were subsets of those found in the larger parks, because the system was nested. Although ‘single large’ thus seems to be a better prospect than ‘several small’ for native bird conservation in forested parks in suburban Melbourne, the two smallest parks still each contained about 25% of the total native species pool of the entire suite of parks. They thus contained enough native species to have conservation value in suburbs lacking large parks, particularly in terms of the role that they can play through ‘contact with
nature’ (Nilon and Pais, 1997) in promoting human well-being and community awareness of the importance of conserving regional biodiversity. There were some caveats with respect to the value of eastern Melbourne’s forested parks as ‘habitat islands’ for native birds: (a) they clearly constituted good quality habitat for exotic turtle-doves, blackbirds and, to a lesser extent, mynas; (b) many of the more abundant native bird species in the parks, including four of the most widespread, are also abundant in more open parks and/or streetscapes and gardens in suburban Melbourne (e.g. red wattlebird) (Green, 1984) and (c) some of the native species that are uncommon in other suburban Melbourne habitats occurred only in very small numbers in the forested parks
too (e.g. the white-eared honeyeater). On the other hand, there were a few native species that are relatively uncommon in the suburbs’ other habitats, but which were present in substantial numbers in the forested parks (e.g. white-naped honeyeater Melithreptus lunatus and striated thornbill). Thus the special native bird conservation value of the forested parks that we studied lay in providing habitat for a few ecological specialists that are rare in residential suburban Melbourne (e.g. treecreepers) and for some species that occur at intermediate to low densities in other suburban habitats (e.g. white-browed scrubwren Sericornis frontalis). As Parsons et al. (2003) concluded for Sydney, it is these ‘fragment specialists’ occurring primarily in native forest and woodland remnants that make retention of these ‘habitat islands’ vital in maintaining a broad array of bird species in the urban landscape.",,RK
